1,Rock Pigeon,/species/rocpig/IN-PB-SH,"Fairly large pigeon with wild and feral populations throughout the world. True wild birds nest on cliffs and in caves from western Europe to central Asia. Pale gray overall with two bold black wingbars and iridescent purple and green on neck. Feral varieties are common in cities and farmland, often in large flocks. Variable plumage: some identical to wild-type birds, but can be completely black, white, or orangey-brown and any combination in between."
2,Eurasian Collared-Dove,/species/eucdov/IN-PB-SH,"Large pale dove with a black crescent on the nape. Slightly smaller and paler than Rock Pigeon, with a proportionately longer, square-tipped tail. Favors farms and suburbs; avoids areas with extensive forests. Typically seen in pairs or small loose groups; forms larger flocks in winter. Widespread and common throughout much of Eurasia and northern Africa. Introduced to, and established in, much of North America, the Caribbean, and parts of Central America. Compare with African Collared-Dove, which may occur in small feral populations or as an escapee throughout Eurasian Collared-Dove’s range. Especially note tail pattern from below: mostly white, contrasting with the grayish undertail coverts, and with black extending down the outer edge of the tail feathers. Voice - a cooing “woop-WOOO!-woop” - is also helpful."
3,Laughing Dove,/species/laudov1/IN-PB-SH,"Small, similar in size to European Turtle-Dove. Tail is strikingly long with white corners and a grey center, but is all white underneath. Its body is pastel shades of brown and pink with a spotted black collar. Usually associated with human-modified landscapes, such as plantations, gardens, and urban areas as long as some trees are present. The call is a repetitious “coo- coo coo ru” replicated 5–8 times."
4,Black Kite,/species/blakit1/IN-PB-SH,"Medium-sized, rather nondescript raptor with overall dark plumage. Varies considerably across range, but always note tail fork (can disappear when tail is fully open), and short head and neck. Juvenile averages paler and more contrastingly-marked. Flight style buoyant, gliding and changing direction with ease. Frequently forages in urban areas, rubbish dumps, aquatic habitats, and grassland, but usually avoids heavily forested areas. Sometimes solitary, but also gathers in large flocks on migration and at good feeding areas."
5,Rose-ringed Parakeet,/species/rorpar/IN-PB-SH,"Vibrantly bright green parakeet, frequently found in woodland, parks, and gardens, where it feeds mainly in trees. Nests in cavities, including holes in buildings. Easily overlooked if quiet, as the bright green plumage blends easily with foliage. Note the very long slender tail and bright red bill; male has narrow black-and-pink neck ring. Closely resembles the larger Alexandrine Parakeet, which has a wine-red patch on each shoulder. Like other parakeets, raucous and social, often appearing in noisy groups giving sharp screeching calls. Native to Africa and South Asia, introduced locally around the world, from Europe and the Caribbean to Japan and Hawaii."
6,House Crow,/species/houcro1/IN-PB-SH,"A slender, blackish medium-sized crow with a long bill. The grayish nape and sides form a paler collar that contrasts with the glossy black body. Primarily a scavenger, feeding on leftover rubbish from humans. Found in a wide range of habitats mostly around human habitation. Their call is a loud and harsh “kaa kaa kaa.”"
7,Common Tailorbird,/species/comtai1/IN-PB-SH,"A common warblerlike bird with a green back, a reddish crown, and a long bill. It gets its name from the way in which it builds its nest by stitching leaves together. A ubiquitous inhabitant of parks, gardens, and wooded areas across South and Southeast Asia. Its loud “tuui-tuui…” and “whee-whee…” calls are often part of the sound of daily life in human habitation. Co-occurs with the very similar Dark-necked Tailorbird in NE India and SE Asia, but is separable by call, and by the lack of a rufous hind-crown, and yellow vent."
8,Red-vented Bulbul,/species/revbul/IN-PB-SH,"A dark, sleek, medium-sized bird with a black crest and a white rump. The red color under the tail is often difficult to see. Eats fruit, flower buds, and insects. Conspicuous and sometimes gregarious, often seen high in trees or perched on wires in urban and rural areas; generally prefers scrubby edge habitat instead of dense forest. Calls include a variety of chirps and whistles. Native to South and Southeast Asia. Introduced to Kuwait, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Oman, and some Polynesian islands, including Hawaii."
9,Common Chiffchaff,/species/comchi1/IN-PB-SH,"A very plain leaf warbler found in a variety of wooded and scrubby habitats, often near water. Best identified by voice: song is a slightly jerky double-noted chiff-chaff, chiff-chaff..., very different from song of the similar Willow Warbler. Relative to Willow Warbler, Chiffchaff is often duller, more brownish overall with weaker pale eyebrow, dark legs, and tends to habitually dip its tail. Also similar to Booted and Sykes’s Warbler, but these are browner toned with darkish legs and bill."
10,Jungle Babbler,/species/junbab2/IN-PB-SH,"This familiar ash-brown colored babbler has a yellow bill and a dark brow in front of the eye that contrasts with its pale eye giving it a perpetual “angry” look. It has vague streaking on the upperparts, diffuse mottling on its throat, and barring on its tail. The multiple races vary slightly in color and strength of markings except the race somervillei of the NW peninsula which has dark brown outer wing feathers that contrast with the rest of the wing. They are often seen in noisy flocks hopping on the ground and flicking litter in search of food."
11,Common Myna,/species/commyn/IN-PB-SH,"A large, black-and-brown myna with white wing patches, yellow bill, and yellow legs. Gregarious and often found in noisy flocks. Aggressive, often driving away other birds. Can be found just about anywhere but the densest forests. Native to southern Asia, where it is among the most common species. Widely introduced elsewhere in the world, including Australia, New Zealand, and Hawaii."
12,Brown Rock Chat,/species/indcha1/IN-PB-SH,"Plain chocolate-brown chat, often seen standing tall and proud on ridges, cliff edges, and buildings. Female Indian Robin can be somewhat similar; note Brown Rock Chat’s proportionally shorter tail and lack of a rufous vent. Lovely song is composed of warbles and trills. Most common call is a slightly descending “chee.”"
13,Bar-headed Goose,/species/bahgoo/IN-PB-SH,"Striking and distinctive goose. Bold black-and-white head and neck pattern unlike any other goose; also note orangey-yellow bill and legs. In flight appears mainly pale gray with broad black trailing edge to wings. Breeds around lakes and marshes on highland plateaus; winters in lowland wetlands and fields. Native to East and South Asia, but escapees from waterfowl collections are occasionally seen free-flying elsewhere in the world."
14,Graylag Goose,/species/gragoo/IN-PB-SH,"Large gray goose. Rather bulky and overall brownish gray with a big pinkish-orange bill and pinkish legs. In flight shows extensively pale gray leading edge to upperwings, rather pale underwing coverts, and broad white tail tip. Compare to other gray geese, which differ in details of bill pattern and color, head and neck pattern, and have dark underwings. Inhabits lakes, marshes, and wetlands, and even urban parks in parts of its European range."
15,Knob-billed Duck,/species/comduc2/IN-PB-SH,"Large bicolored waterbird. Both sexes are iridescent purplish-green above with a white or buffy breast. Males have a large black lump on the bill, gray flanks and whitish belly, whereas females have a plain bill and gray flanks. Note all dark wings. Occurs throughout much of Africa, India, and Southeast Asia. Found in freshwater rivers, lakes, and marshes where it is usually uncommon. Normally silent."
16,Northern Shoveler,/species/norsho/IN-PB-SH,"Medium-sized duck; smaller than a Mallard. Huge, spoon-shaped bill visible at a distance and in flight. Breeding males have dark green head, white breast, and chestnut sides and belly. Females buffy-brown with large, distinctive bill. Chalky-blue upperwing. Forages by sifting through the water, often swimming in spirals in groups."
17,Indian Spot-billed Duck,/species/isbduc1/IN-PB-SH,"A large grayish-brown duck with a diagnostic yellow-tipped black bill and a red spot at the base of the bill (missing in certain subspecies). In flight, note the green panel in the wing that is bordered in white. Often seen in small groups dabbling or tipping up in shallow water or walking on marshy land at the edge of freshwater lakes or in cultivated fields. Usually not seen associating with other species. Similar to Eastern Spot-billed Duck, but note green wing panel, lack of a distinct dark ""moustache"", and overall warmer tan coloration."
18,Green-winged Teal,/species/gnwtea/IN-PB-SH,"Tiny duck with a petite, thin bill. Males have a brown head with a wide green swatch behind the eye, creamy speckled breast, and mostly gray body. Females are brown, darker overall than other dabbling ducks. Forages by dabbling and tipping-up to reach submerged aquatic vegetation. Also regularly walks around mudflats to feed."
19,Little Grebe,/species/litgre1/IN-PB-SH,"Fairly common but often inconspicuous small diving bird of wetlands with bordering reeds and other vegetation. Often remains out of sight; less often out on open water (mainly in winter). Rather compact, with rounded head, puffy rear end. Seen mainly as singles and small loose flocks, often sleeping during the day. Breeding plumage often looks dark overall; in good light note dark rusty head and neck sides with yellow patch at base of bill. Nonbreeding plumage dingy pale brownish overall with dark cap."
20,Greater Coucal,/species/grecou1/IN-PB-SH,"A large bird that resembles a cross between a crow and a pheasant. Largely black with distinctive rusty wings, glossy underparts, a long and heavy black tail, and deep red eyes. Juveniles are much duller with white bars on the tail and underparts and variable amounts of black streaks on the wings and upperparts. Common across a range of habitats except very dense forests. Similar to Lesser Coucal, but Greater Coucal is larger with a longer bill and red eyes. Adult Greater Coucals also lack the white streaks on the wings seen on Lesser Coucal. The call is a series of deep, resonant “oop-oop-oop” notes."
21,White-breasted Waterhen,/species/whbwat1/IN-PB-SH,"Medium-sized, fairly common chickenlike marsh bird found in meadows, ditches, riversides, marshes, as well as parks and farmlands in close proximity to humans; often seen foraging in the open. Adults are dark slaty above and white below, with a rusty patch under the tail. Juvenile similar but duller in color. Remarkably variable song is a series of hooting, grunting, or rasping notes or phrases, repeated monotonously, often from an exposed perch."
22,Black-winged Stilt,/species/bkwsti/IN-PB-SH,"Striking large black-and-white wader with a thin, straight bill and bright pink legs, found in wetlands with open shallow water throughout much of Africa and Eurasia, often in brackish habitats. Some populations are migratory, departing northerly breeding grounds for warmer southern regions. Often forms noisy colonies on bare ground near water. Essentially unmistakable throughout much of its range, but compare with Pied Stilt in parts of Southeast Asia. Feeds by wading in water, picking from the water surface with its needle-like bill. In flight, long pink legs stick out far beyond the tail. Calls loudly and stridently, especially when alarmed during the breeding season."
23,Red-wattled Lapwing,/species/rewlap1/IN-PB-SH,"A distinctly marked lapwing with a black breast and throat and a red bill with a black tip. It also sports red wattles in front of the eyes and a white patch that runs down the cheeks to the underparts. In flight, note the black flight feathers that contrast with the white wing patch. Usually found in small groups around water bodies, agricultural fields, and dry land. They feed primarily on insects, catching them in a typical plover like manner, running a short distance and picking up food from ground. A bird known for its characteristics loud alarm call, often compared to the words “Did we do it?”"
24,White-tailed Lapwing,/species/whtlap1/IN-PB-SH,"An elegant, rather small lapwing. Pale sandy-brown overall with long, bright yellow legs. In flight, a striking tri-colored wing pattern of brown, black, and white is exposed. Somewhat similar to Sociable Lapwing, but note all-white, instead of black-tipped, tail. Often seen in heavily vegetated wetlands."
25,Painted Stork,/species/paisto1/IN-PB-SH,"A large stork with a long yellow bill that curves down at the tip, like that of an Ibis. Adult is primarily white with black striped markings on the wings and bright pink on tertials. Also note the bright orange face, pinkish legs, and speckled band across the chest. Immatures are duller, with a brown wash, and lack the chest band. These storks typically fly with their head and neck drooping almost at or below the belly level. Often seen near water bodies such as wetlands, marshes, and flooded agricultural fields. Breeds in crowded colonies, often with other waterbirds."
26,Little Cormorant,/species/litcor1/IN-PB-SH,"An all black ducklike waterbird with a distinctive flattish head and a bill that is sharply hooked at the tip. Smallest of the cormorants found in the region. Breeding adults have white plumes on the sides of the head. Like all cormorants, frequently seen swimming with its body low in the water, head and neck pointing upward, and suddenly disappearing underwater to catch fish. Often perches upright on a rock, drying itself with outstretched wings. Seen singly or in small groups in inland water bodies. Similar to Indian Cormorant, but note smaller size, stouter bill, and shape of the head, flat on Little Cormorant and rounded on Indian Cormorant."
27,Great Cormorant,/species/grecor/IN-PB-SH,"Large cormorant found nearly worldwide. Note large size, white patch on throat, and lack of crest. Breeding adults show circular white patch on flanks. Immatures typically have contrasting white belly; African ""White-breasted"" also has extensive white underparts in all plumages. Often spotted standing on rocks or pilings. Dives frequently, feeding on fish. Found in many types of water bodies, ranging from rivers to reservoirs to marine environments; in North America, restricted to coastal North Atlantic."
28,Indian Pond-Heron,/species/inpher1/IN-PB-SH,"A small heron that is common in most aquatic habitats across the Indian subcontinent. Adults in breeding plumage have a dark reddish brown back that contrasts with a yellowish head, neck, and breast. In nonbreeding plumage they are virtually indistinguishable from nonbreeding Chinese Pond-Heron. In flight, adults appear surprisingly white due to their strikingly white wings, underparts, and tail. Although typically solitary, large numbers often gather where food is plentiful. Prone to seasonally local movements and vagrancy."
29,Eastern Cattle Egret,/species/categr2/IN-PB-SH,"Small, compact white heron with relatively short yellow bill. More often seen in dry habitats than other egrets, but also frequent in rice paddies and shallow wetlands. In the breeding season, look for bright orange head and breast, as well as a brighter bill. Leg color varies from reddish or yellow during the breeding season to black during the nonbreeding season. Juveniles have dark bill. Always note relatively short, thick neck and short legs compared with other egrets. Often gathers in flocks, frequently following large animals and field machinery."
30,Gray Heron,/species/graher1/IN-PB-SH,"Generally quite common and conspicuous in wetland habitats from marshes and tidal flats to small ponds, ditches, and wet fields; nests colonially in tall trees. Mainly seen as singles or in small groups, standing quietly in or at the edge of water, less often hunting in fields. Plumage mostly gray overall, with paler neck; adult has white crown, black eyebrows, and black shoulder patch. Like other herons and egrets, flies with neck pulled in to form a bulge."
31,Purple Heron,/species/purher1/IN-PB-SH,"Large heron with rusty head and streaky neck; juvenile is extensively rusty brown on upperparts. Favors fresh marshes with tall reeds and other vegetation. Often more retiring than Gray Heron and rarely seen in open situations. Only likely to be confused with larger and bulkier Gray Heron, which is paler and grayer overall, with a stouter bill."
32,Black-winged Kite,/species/bkskit1/IN-PB-SH,"Small and distinctive falconlike kite. Light underneath, blue-gray above with conspicuous black shoulders formed by black wing coverts. Juveniles have a scaly back and brownish-washed breast. Found in open savannah, semi-desert, and agricultural lands with scattered woods; frequently seen on exposed perches. Varied flight style, hovering like a kestrel or gliding like a harrier with deep wingbeats and raised wings."
33,White-throated Kingfisher,/species/whtkin2/IN-PB-SH,"Large-headed, predominantly brown kingfisher with electric-blue back and wings, heavy red bill, and snow-white patch from the throat through the breast. Common both near and away from water; frequently seen perched on fence posts and telephone lines near wetlands, lakes, agricultural fields, and clearings. Gives jarring, raptor-like descending trills and cackles, often in flight."
34,Black Drongo,/species/bladro1/IN-PB-SH,"An adaptable songbird of open areas such as farmland, forest edge, meadows, wetlands, and fields and a common sight as a familiar dark silhouette perched on wires, fences, or snags. Black plumage flashes blue and green iridescence in favorable light, though much less so than in Hair-crested or Bronzed Drongo. A pugnacious species, frequently chasing away larger birds with repeated dives and harsh chattering calls. A skilled mimic of other species, and a strong songster in general, delivering a wide range of pleasant fluty calls, harsh chattering, nasal notes, and high sharp whistles."
35,Rufous Treepie,/species/ruftre2/IN-PB-SH,"A long- and stiff-tailed bird with primarily rusty-brown upperparts and dull orangish underparts. The head, mantle, and neck region are a dull, sooty black. The long graduated tail is pale gray with a wide black terminal band. Note the conspicuous silvery-gray, white, and black patterns on the wings. The blackish-gray bill is stout with a hooked tip. Found in a wide range of habitats from woodlands to scrubby patches, singly or in pairs feeding in the treetops. The call is a loud metallic “krowwiiii kroo.”"
36,Bank Myna,/species/banmyn1/IN-PB-SH,"Dapper inhabitant of cities, towns, and farmland. Combination of gray body, dark head and wings, and bright orange face and bill are unique. Exposes flashing pale wing patches in flight. Forages on the grounds, often in flocks; visits garbage dumps, food markets, and animal feedlots."
37,Indian Robin,/species/indrob1/IN-PB-SH,"A nondescript robin; males are primarily black with chestnut bottom feathers, although males in the northern population have brownish upperparts. Males also have a white shoulder patch and a relatively long tail. Females have completely brown upperparts, lack the male’s white shoulder patch, and have grayish-brown underparts. They are generally seen in pairs, foraging on the ground with the tail cocked up. Found in open country, at forest edges, around human habitation, and in scrub lands."
38,Siberian Stonechat,/species/sibsto1/IN-PB-SH,"Chunky little bird of open landscapes; often sits on exposed perches. Breeding male has a black head, broad white half-collar, and rusty-red chest. Non-breeding male is patchier, with a paler head and chest. Female is predominantly streaky brown above, with a weaker, less contrasting face and chest pattern. European Stonechat is very similar, and can pose identification problems where the species overlap; look for Siberian’s larger white wing patch, duller orange on the chest, and whiter rump. Amur Stonechat is extremely similar, and in areas of overlap, or in cases of vagrancy, most individuals are inseparable based on current knowledge."
39,House Sparrow,/species/houspa/IN-PB-SH,"Widespread and abundant in cities, neighborhoods and farms. Avoids dense woods. Flocks cluster in dense bushes, bustling around and chattering to one another. Males have smart black bibs, bright rufous napes, and stunningly patterned wings with brilliant buffs and browns. Underparts are pale pearly-gray. Females are plain brown with cute face and lighter eyebrow. Native to Eurasia; introduced to much of the rest of the world."

Occurs in open grassy areas such as dry grasslands, scrub, and agricultural land. Often found in groups. Call, sometimes given simultaneously by several birds, is a loud repetitive “kateetar-kateetar”. Native to South Asia; introduced to Hawaii where it is common in dry areas on all Hawaiian islands."
42,Shikra,/species/shikra1/IN-PB-SH,"A common, widespread resident across Asia and Africa. Adult males have a reddish iris, blue gray upperparts and fine brownish-orange barring on underparts. Females have a yellowish iris and brownish gray upperparts. Both have narrow dark barring on the tail. Juveniles are browner with a prominent moustachial stripe and streaked underparts. It hunts for a wide variety of prey in woodland, savannah, and even suburban gardens, dashing out from perches within vegetation to grab its prey."
43,Himalayan Bulbul,/species/whcbul2/IN-PB-SH,"Sharp-looking bulbul with a spiffy mohawk. Note black face and throat, bright white cheek spot, and yellow vent. A species of foothill and montane forested areas; also found in brush, gardens, and towns. Tame and unafraid of people.

Calls include dry raspings, chups, and squeaks."
44,Hume's Warbler,/species/humwar1/IN-PB-SH,"Compact leaf warbler with two whitish wingbars (one broad and prominent), greenish-gray upperparts, an indistinct crown stripe, and conspicuous white tips to the innermost flight feathers. Bill and legs usually dark. Extremely similar to Yellow-browed Warbler, but grayer and “colder” overall, with less extensive orangish coloration on the lower bill. Also compare with Two-barred Warbler and Greenish Warbler, both of which lack a crown stripe and have more extensive orange on the bill. Breeds in alpine shrubbery in mountain ranges flanking the Tibetan Plateau. Winters mostly in the plains just south of the Himalayas, but also on wet hilltops farther south. Often heard but not seen, it is best told from other leaf warblers by its distinct “chew-wee” call. Song is a remarkable descending insect-like buzz. Prone to long-distance vagrancy."
45,Indian White-eye,/species/indwhe1/IN-PB-SH,"Hyperactive little yellow bird with an off-white belly and white “spectacles.” Found in a wide range of habitats, from mangroves to gardens to forest edge; generally favors more open forested areas, not dense tangles. Travels in flocks, sometimes mixed in with other species. Note light bouncing flight. Gives bright but faint “zwee!” calls both while foraging and in flight."
46,Oriental Magpie-Robin,/species/magrob/IN-PB-SH,"A medium-sized robin with a broad white wingbar running from the shoulder to the tip of the wing. Note white outertail feathers, particularly when in flight. Males sport black-and-white plumage while the females are grayish brown and white.

48,Eurasian Wigeon,/species/eurwig/IN-PB-SH,"Breeding males are beautiful and distinctive with rich reddish-brown head, buffy forehead, pearly gray body, and pinkish breast. Look for large white wing patches in flight. Females are plainer warm brown overall, with a small pale bill. Very difficult to distinguish from female American Wigeon; note warmer brown head on Eurasian with little contrast between head, breast, and sides. Also look for dirty grayish, not bright white, underwings in flight, but this can be difficult to judge, especially at a distance. Widespread and common in Eurasia, breeding at northern latitudes and wintering south to central Africa and Southeast Asia. Typically in flocks on lakes and wetlands, often grazing in nearby fields. Regular winter visitor to North America, especially on the west coast, usually in very small numbers among flocks of American Wigeon."

Locally in flocks, and often associates with winter flocks of Tufted Ducks. Feeds mainly by diving."
51,Eurasian Moorhen,/species/commoo3/IN-PB-SH,"Distinctive dark waterbird that resembles a cross between a duck and a chicken. Adults have a bright red bill with a yellow tip, while immatures have a duller bill and legs. Note big white oval patches under the tail, and white streaks along the flanks. Inhabits fresh and brackish marshes, on ponds, lakes, and along slow-moving watercourses with bordering vegetation. Smaller and more retiring than coot, and rarely far out on open water. Swims with jerky motion and walks with stealthy gait, the tail often slightly cocked; does not usually dive. Gives a variety of loud, somewhat frog-like calls."
52,Eurasian Coot,/species/eurcoo/IN-PB-SH,"Distinctive stocky waterbird. Adult is dark gray overall with a white bill and forehead shield. Immature has a pale breast and a duller bill that becomes brighter white with age. When walking on shore, note big feet with lobed toes. Inhabits both freshwater and brackish marshes, lakeshores, and riverways; occasionally on saltwater. Breeding pairs aggressively territorial but nonbreeding flocks can number in hundreds. Unmistakable throughout much of range, but compare with very similar Red-knobbed Coot in areas of overlap. Calls are diverse, and include various high-pitched squeaks, squawks, and shorter, more clipped notes."
53,Gray-headed Swamphen,/species/purswa3/IN-PB-SH,"A very large bluish-purple waterbird with a red bill and forehead shield, as well as red legs and feet with long toes. The tail is flicked up often, revealing fluffy white “underpants.” Juveniles are duller than adults and lack the red bill and shield. An inhabitant of marshy, vegetated freshwater bodies such as swamps, rivers, and lakes; usually in small groups. Feeds, often clumsily, at muddy water edges, in reeds, and on floating vegetation. Makes short nasal grunts and croaking sounds. Formerly part of the species known as Purple Swamphen."
54,Common Sandpiper,/species/comsan/IN-PB-SH,"Small bicolored sandpiper which often bobs its tail in a distinctively wagtail-like manner. Plain brown with white underparts; distinguished from bulkier and rounder-headed Green Sandpiper by a prominent white spur at the shoulder. Found in a variety of wetland habitats; breeds on stony ground along rivers and lakeshores, with migrants occurring on muddy and rocky substrates from concrete canal banks to channels in tidal mudflats. Mainly found as singles or in small groups, not in flocks or mixed with other species."
55,Wood Sandpiper,/species/woosan/IN-PB-SH,"Medium-sized brownish wader with a white belly, varied pale spotting and spangling on back. In flight shows plain upperwings, square white rump patch.

58,Great Egret,/species/greegr/IN-PB-SH,"Large, lanky, long-necked white heron. Size and black legs help separate from other egrets. Widespread and fairly common across the globe. Bill color varies across range: always yellow in the Americas, black in breeding season elsewhere. Occurs in any shallow wetland, including ponds, marshes, and tidal mudflats. Slowly stalks prey in shallow water. Often seen singly, but sometimes gathers in large numbers where food is plentiful. Breeds in colonies, frequently mixed with other egrets and herons."
59,White-browed Wagtail,/species/whbwag1/IN-PB-SH,"A rather largish wagtail and the only resident amongst this group. It has black head, back, and upper tail, and white underparts. The broad white eyebrow that extends from the base of the bill to the back of its head is a characteristic. A broad white bar on the wing is visible when sitting and in flight. Female is usually duller black than the male, while immatures have a shorter eyebrow with black areas replaced by grayish-brown and have dirty white underparts. Very vocal; gives a loud 3–4 noted whistle and a “psi-sit” flight call. Mostly seen in pairs or family parties, near wet areas of any kind including small pools in lawns and buildings, running around wagging its tail and flying with a characteristic undulating flight."
60,Garganey,/species/gargan/IN-PB-SH,"Small and often rather unobtrusive duck of wetlands with reedy and other fringing vegetation.

Distinctive within its range, but compare with larger Great and Intermediate Egrets, stockier Cattle Egret, and white morph reef herons."
62,Red-naped Ibis,/species/renibi1/IN-PB-SH,"A medium-sized ibis with a dark body, often showing a bluish-green sheen. The crown and nape are covered in bright red warts. A white patch is usually visible near the shoulder of the wing. The bill is long and downcurved. This species can be confused with the similar-looking Glossy Ibis, but Glossy Ibis is smaller and lacks the red warts and white shoulder patch. In flight, the legs of Red-naped Ibis don’t extend beyond the tail, unlike in Glossy Ibis. Unlike most other ibis, Red-naped favors drier habitats, such as rye fields. It is usually found singly or in loose groups."
63,Spotted Dove,/species/spodov/IN-PB-SH,"A common garden bird throughout much of Asia, found in open forests, fields, and parks; introduced to several regions around the world. Often tame and approachable. Brown overall with a rosy breast and a unique white-spotted black nape patch. Plumage shows slight regional variation: western birds have dark centers to wing feathers, lacking in eastern birds. Turtle-doves are larger, have black centers to wing feathers and stripes rather than spots on the neck. Coos loudly and often: “coo-a-roooo”."
64,Green Sandpiper,/species/grnsan/IN-PB-SH,"Dark brown sandpiper with a snowy white belly; in flight looks black above with boldly contrasting white rump. Bobs tail when nervous, but not habitually like Common Sandpiper. Often climbs steeply when flushed and flies quickly with deep wingbeats, swooping around a little like a swallow. Breeds in clearings and marshes in wet forest and woodland; migrants occur in fresh and brackish wetland habitats, especially on muddy shores of lakes and small ponds. Mainly found as singles or small groups, not mixed with other species."
65,Plain Prinia,/species/plapri1/IN-PB-SH,"A common prinia with drab gray-brown plumage that varies in tone across its range. Note the pale, wide eyebrow and the long tail that appears as if it is loosely attached to the body. Breeding birds have a black bill and a shorter tail. Common in various habitats, especially farms and wetlands, but avoids woodlands with a canopy. A somewhat bold species, it often skulks in the undergrowth but sings from exposed perches. The song is a repeated series of insectlike trills. Calls include various buzzing and clinking notes. Also produces snapping sounds with its wings."
66,Greenish Warbler,/species/grewar3/IN-PB-SH,"Green on the back and pale below; has a strong white eyebrow which is broad behind the eye and goes all the way to the forehead. Usually has one broad pale wingbar. Can be very unobtrusive and difficult to spot. Breeds in lowland and montane deciduous and mixed forest. Song is a high-pitched long series ""tsit-psityee psityu-psi-ti-ti-ti-ti-si,"" but often detected by its call, a two-parted ""t-sli"" with flat or downward inflection. Similar to Green Warbler which co-occurs on wintering ground, best separated by call and Green's brighter green back and yellower underside."
67,Lesser Whitethroat,/species/leswhi4/IN-PB-SH,"Small brownish-gray warbler with a grayer head and broad dark mask that sets off the white throat. Lacks bright rusty wing patch of Greater Whitethroat. Varies subtly across wide range. Found in scrubby habitats, especially dense hedges with thorny bushes and trees. Skulking and difficult to see well; often located by scratchy chortling song that ends with a distinctive loud rattle. Gives dry ticking calls."
68,Bluethroat,/species/blueth/IN-PB-SH,"Beautiful thrush-like bird that tends to stay hidden. Dull gray above, but a head-on view reveals a stunning pattern of electric blue and orange on the throat (some variation in pattern across range). Females show fainter colors than males, sometimes lacking blue entirely, but are still very boldly patterned. On the dullest young females, look for bold white eyebrow and throat, necklace of dark streaks, and rufous on the base of the tail. Variable song includes imitations of other species among a jumble of trills, whistles, and chirps. Typically found in scrubby, brushy habitat, often in edge areas: reedbeds, overgrown fields, and thickets. Usually skulky but singing males can perch conspicuously atop a bush. Breeds across Europe and Asia into Alaska; winters from northern Africa to southeast Asia."
69,Pied Bushchat,/species/piebus1/IN-PB-SH,"A sedentary “chat” associated with open habitats in tropical and subtropical Asia. Males are black with a white vent and a white wing patch. Females are dark brown with a reddish-brown rump and underparts. Females can resemble the migratory Siberian Stonechat, but can be separated by the absence of an eyebrow and of any white on the collar or wing. Rather conspicuous; it may use and sing from any open perch unlike more discerning stonechats. Calls include a rising “whee” and hard, decisive “chruk.”"
70,Common Redshank,/species/comred1/IN-PB-SH,"Stocky brown wader with bright red legs; compare with slenderer, far more gracile Spotted Redshank in juvenile and non-breeding plumage. Often rather wary, alerting other birds with its loud, fluty, whistled calls. Bobs tail when nervous, and then flies to show flashy white trailing edge to wings, white rump patch. Feeds in muddy shallows, probing and picking with its bill. Inhabits fresh and coastal wetlands; also breeds on moorland, usually near water."
71,Eurasian Kestrel,/species/eurkes/IN-PB-SH,"Small falcon with distinctive male plumage: gray head, rusty back, gray tail with broad black tip. Female is brownish above, with barring on the back, wings, and tail. Note rather pointed wingtips (unlike rounded wings of Accipiter hawks), and distinct dark spotting on the breast. Inhabits open and lightly wooded country, farmlands, grasslands, and heathlands; often seen over grassy areas beside roads and at airports. Perches on wires and posts, and typically hunts by hovering, at times fairly high overhead. Very similar to Lesser Kestrel."
72,Ashy Prinia,/species/ashpri1/IN-PB-SH,"A common prinia that is likely to occur in all habitats except for woodlands with a thick canopy. All birds have a black bill, pale cinnamon underparts, a gray head, and a grayish-brown back. Nonbreeding birds acquire a short eyebrow and a longer tail. There is a marked variation in plumage tones in various parts of its range. It usually sticks to the undergrowth and shrubbery, though individuals often sing from a higher perch such as wires. Usually occurring in ones and twos, and it can be quite bold and fearless. It has a loud ringing song that is given year-round and a plain nasal call."
73,Indian Silverbill,/species/indsil/IN-PB-SH,"Small, long-tailed finch with a chunky body and short, stout bill. Gray-brown above and pale below with a whitish rump and black-pointed tail. Highly sociable throughout the year. Found in semidesert, scrub, and dry woodland but also proliferates in urban areas. Distribution is centered on the Indian subcontinent, but it is a popular cage bird and feral populations are widespread. Gives sharp “tsik” and “tseet” calls."
74,Western Yellow Wagtail,/species/eaywag1/IN-PB-SH,"Widespread wagtail, favoring wet meadows, marshland, grassy and muddy lakeshores. Occurs in fields and often near livestock during migration. Like other wagtails, walks on ground and pumps its long, white-sided tail up and down. Plumage highly variable, but breeding male wholly bright yellow below, with greenish back. Male head pattern varies regionally: in U.K. has greenish head with yellow eyebrow; in northern Europe head slaty gray overall; in central and southwest Europe head blue-gray with white eyebrow; striking white-headed birds in Mongolia and northwestern China. Individuals of several subspecies may winter together. Female and nonbreeding plumages drabber and paler, with ghosting of male patterns. Songs and calls vary between subspecies, but most give some form of buzzy “dzeerdzeer” or downslurrd “tzree.”"
75,White Wagtail,/species/whiwag/IN-PB-SH,"Distinctive but variable: all plumages are some bold combination of black, white, and gray. Shows considerable variation in plumage across the world, but never has a clear, thin and contrasting eye-brow like White-browed or Japanese Wagtail. Occurs in varied open habitats, from wild grassy areas and wetlands to paved car parks and grassy lawns. Usually seen as singles, pairs, or small groups walking and running around, pumping the long, white-sided tail up and down. Identified easily in flight by its loud, thick and distinctive “tsee-tsee’ call."
76,Indian Roller,/species/indrol2/IN-PB-SH,"A brightly colored bird with various shades of blue on the wings, tails, and belly that are often more prominent in flight. Note the longitudinal white streaks on the throat and breast. Indochinese Roller has a purple-blue breast, a darker olive back, and is generally darker blue. Generally silent, but more vocal in breeding season with harsh calls. Prefers open areas, including agricultural landscapes, sitting on exposed perches including electric wires, occasionally pumping its tail slowly. Practically a resident roller with some movements in the western parts of its range."
77,White-throated Fantail,/species/whtfan1/IN-PB-SH,"A distinctive fantail, all dark except for a white throat and a short white eyebrow. The tail, often fanned, is a shade darker with white tips to all tail feathers except the central pair. Juvenile is like adult, but with reduced white on face and brownish edges to the dark body feathers. Gives very harsh contact calls. Song is a musical phrase of 6-7 notes that ascends first and then descends. Found in a wide range of wooded habitats, from dense forest to forest edge and gardens, from lowlands up into the mountains."
78,Cinereous Tit,/species/gretit2/IN-PB-SH,"An uncrested gray, black, and off-white tit of light woodlands. Males and females have a white cheek patch, a gray back, and a white wingbar. A broad black central line, that is widest on throat, runs from the throat to the lower belly. The female has a narrower central line on its underparts and is slightly duller overall. Sings variations of a three noted “swee-che-ti” or a “sewe-pewe” repeated 4-5 times at length. Calls include small chatters. Very active; feeds at the middle and upper-strata of forests and woodlands and in gardens and cultivated areas, but avoids dense forests."
79,Red-breasted Flycatcher,/species/rebfly/IN-PB-SH,"Distinctive, small flycatcher. Males have a rusty-orange throat that continues onto the breast. All plumages have a distinctive tail pattern with black terminal bar and white sides. Wings relatively plain and white eyering noticeable. When perched, tail is often held cocked with wingtips drooping. Compare with the very similar Taiga Flycatcher; note the more extensive orange throat in breeding male, warmer overall coloration, and more extensive pale pinkish on the bill base. Breeds in mature deciduous mixed forest, winters in forest, woodland and parks. Song is a series of bland and repetitive but sweet whistles, often with a few fuzzy notes as an intro. Often detected by a rattling ""zrrrt"" call, slower than that of Taiga Flycatcher."
80,Black Redstart,/species/blared1/IN-PB-SH,"Distinctive orange tail, best seen when flashed open or in flight. Varies considerably within range. Western birds are darker overall; male is slaty blackish, female smoky grayish overall. Eastern males have extensive orange on the underparts, and females are warm brown. Song also varies: western birds give a short trill preceded by a few buzzy intro notes, while eastern birds incorporate buzzy and trilled elements. Calls include high-pitched “tseet” and dry clicks. Occupies varied open habitats, often but not always with a rocky component. Feeds mainly on or near the ground, perching rather upright; sings from prominent perches."
81,Pied Avocet,/species/pieavo1/IN-PB-SH,"Striking and essentially unmistakable, with elegant shape, boldly pied plumage, long bluish-gray legs, and long, slender, upcurved bill. Curve is stronger on female. Usually breeds in small colonies; nesting birds call noisily. Nonbreeding flocks locally number in hundreds. Feeds while wading or swimming, sweeping its bill side to side. Most common in coastal wetlands and brackish lagoons and estuaries, but will also appear inland, particularly on or near large lakes."
82,Ruddy Shelduck,/species/rudshe/IN-PB-SH,"Striking and distinctive gooselike duck. Plumage bright ruddy overall with contrasting pale creamy head and neck; male has narrow black neck ring. Big white forewing patches striking in flight. Breeds in southeastern Europe and Central Asia, winters in South Asia. Often found around saline lakes; also reservoirs and agricultural fields. Escapees from waterfowl collections occasionally seen free-flying outside of native range."
83,Little Ringed Plover,/species/lirplo/IN-PB-SH,"Delicately built small plover with bright yellow eyerings. Note dull pinkish legs and large white forehead patch (in adults). Plumage much like bulkier Ringed Plover, but white eyebrow continues unbroken across forehead. In flight shows narrow, indistinct whitish wing stripe. Breeds on stony substrates around lakes, gravel pits, and along rivers; migrants occur in wide variety of fresh and brackish wetland habitats, but rarely out on open tidal areas. Clipped “peu” call quite distinct from call of similar Common Ringed Plover."
84,Large-billed Crow,/species/labcro1/IN-PB-SH,"A large crow that varies in size across its range; note its relatively long, daggerlike bill with curved top.

Gives loud, screeching calls; also mimics other birds."
86,European Starling,/species/eursta/IN-PB-SH,"Stocky and dark overall with short tail and triangular wings. A close look reveals beautiful plumage: in breeding season, look for purple and green iridescence and a yellow bill. In winter, shows extensive white and buffy spots over the entire body. Juveniles are plain grayish-brown; note bill shape. Native to Eurasia; introduced extensively across the globe. Often abundant, gathering in large flocks in open agricultural areas and towns and cities. Makes a variety of squeaky vocalizations, and often mimics other species. Visits feeders, where it is often aggressive towards other birds."
87,Citrine Wagtail,/species/citwag/IN-PB-SH,"Widespread and fairly common over much of Asia; rare to western Europe. Breeding males spectacular and unmistakable: bright yellow head and body contrasts with black collar and gray (most of range) or black (central and southern Asia) back. Females and non breeding males less conspicuous, dull yellow with dark cheek patch isolated in yellow face and a gray crown and back. Juveniles have same cheek pattern but are dingy grayish overall without yellow tones (or just faint yellow face). White wingbars conspicuous in all plumages; also note pale lores. More tied to water than Eastern Yellow, Western Yellow, or White Wagtail; usually seen at marshes and lake edges. Contact call ""tsriip,"" harsher than Eastern and Western Yellow Wagtail."
88,Temminck's Stint,/species/temsti/IN-PB-SH,"Breeds on wet moorland mainly in Scandinavia and Russia; migrants occur in wide variety of wetland habitats across Africa and southern Asia.

Brightest adult males have tricolored upperwings, grayish tail, pale head and breast contrasting with rusty-brown belly. Extremely similar to closely related Eastern Marsh-Harrier; males of that species are darker-headed and browner-chested, and females are warmer brown and streakier on the chest, without Eurasian's discrete white 'cap' and dark line through the eye."
91,Eurasian Hoopoe,/species/hoopoe/IN-PB-SH,"Utterly unmistakable orange bird with a zebra-striped wings, a Chinese fan of a crest (usually held closed, but often raised just after landing), and a rapier of a bill. Favors semiopen habitats such as heathland, farmland, orchards, grassy lawns, where it feeds on the ground, probing with its long bill for insects. Flight fast and fairly direct, with rather deep wingbeats. Unlikely to be confused, but flight pattern and round wings may loosely resemble that of woodpeckers; note far longer and thinner bill. Song is a distinctive “hoopoopoo.”"
92,Paddyfield Pipit,/species/oripip1/IN-PB-SH,"A sparrow-sized, resident pipit with brown plumage that varies in tones in different parts of its range. All birds have a bi-colored bill with a curve to the tip of the upper bill. The breast is streaked and the upperparts have variable amounts of streaking. Juveniles show distinct and dark mottling on the upperparts. It is common in open habitats such as wetlands, farms, fields, and even large parks.

Calls include short “tsip” and “tissip” notes."
93,Brown-headed Barbet,/species/brhbar1/IN-PB-SH,"A green and brown barbet with prominent pale streaks on its brown head and breast. The brown throat and green wings with white speckling on the shoulders are characteristic of this species. Also note the large area of dull yellow facial skin and the brown-yellow bill that both turn orange-red when breeding. Immature is similar but duller. Heard more often than seen. Several calls exist, but the most common call is similar to the White-cheeked Barbet’s “kutrook-kutrook-kutrook,” but it is more mellow, sonorous, and less sharp sounding. Generally prefers drier woodlands compared to White-cheeked Barbet though they co-occur in many localities."
94,Gray Wagtail,/species/grywag/IN-PB-SH,"Handsome long-tailed bird. Breeding male has a black throat, mostly yellow underparts. Breeding female often has some dark on the throat, paler yellow underparts. All plumages have gray head and back, with whitish eyebrow, bright yellow belly and vent.

Note head and breast pattern and tail length to help separate from various similar species in Africa, Asia, and Australia (e.g., Welcome Swallow, Angolan Swallow, Pacific Swallow)."
117,Red-rumped Swallow,/species/rerswa1/IN-PB-SH,"Brightly-colored swallow with a deeply forked tail, pale orangish rump, black squared-off undertail coverts, and an incomplete orange collar. Varies significantly across range: European and African birds have clean whitish or orangish underparts, while Asian birds are extensively streaked below; compare carefully with other Cecropis swallow species where range overlaps occur. Juveniles average paler and lack extensive orangish tones; may resemble house-martins but note deeply forked tail. Typically glides on stiff, flat wings, flying quite languidly with shallow wingbeats. Builds mud nests in mountains, sea cliffs and on buildings and other structures. Forages over open areas. Frequently gives a short, sparrow-like “twi’wit.”"
118,Wire-tailed Swallow,/species/witswa1/IN-PB-SH,"A very distinctive swallow with two long, thin feathers on its outer tail from which it gets its name. It has brilliant glossy blue upperparts and a chestnut forehead and crown that contrasts with clean white underparts. Females and juveniles have shorter tails. Found in grasslands, wetlands, open scrublands, cultivated areas and near water. Typically seen in singles, pairs, or sometimes small flocks."
119,Red Avadavat,/species/redava/IN-PB-SH,"Strikingly pretty small finch. Males are largely red and covered in white spots with dark wings and tail. Females are gray with a rufous rump. Both sexes have a red beak. Gives a very musical song a high ""teei"" call. Found in grassy areas close to water and often near human habitation, particularly areas with wet rice paddies."
120,Ferruginous Duck,/species/ferduc/IN-PB-SH,"Rich rusty brown overall with contrasting white triangular patch under tail; male has pale eye. Also note peaked crown and rather long gray bill. In flight, both sexes show bold white wing stripe. Compare with female Tufted Duck (can have similar white patch under tail). Inhabits lakes and marshes, usually with surrounding reeds. Rather shy and often stays hidden in reeds, but at other times out in open water with flocks of Tufted Duck and Common Pochard."
121,Egyptian Vulture,/species/egyvul1/IN-PB-SH,"Odd-looking, pale, medium-sized vulture with a bare, solemn-looking yellow face. The bill is narrow with a black tip. In flight, the deep-fingered black flight feathers contrasting with white inner feathers may recall White Stork, but the tail is wedge shaped. Juveniles are dirty brown with bare gray faces. An inhabitant of open or semiopen areas, nesting on cliffs and less frequently in trees. Scavenges at rubbish dumps in addition to carcasses, but sadly is in decline over much of its wide range."
122,Common Snipe,/species/comsni/IN-PB-SH,"Squat, cryptically-plumaged shorebird with a very long bill. Inhabits a wide range of wetland habitats, from damp meadows to saltmarshes. Mostly inconspicuous, feeding in muddy ground by probing with its bill, usually near reeds or other grassy cover. Often not seen until flushed, when it usually rises from fairly close range with a rough rasping call. Breeding birds are more conspicuous, perching on fence posts. In display flight, birds stoop from high overhead and produce a pulsating, bleating sound from air passing through their fanned tail. In Asia, beware of extremely similar Pin-tailed, Swinhoe's, and Latham's Snipes, all of which lack the white trailing edge of Common and have a slower, less erratic flight."
123,Marsh Sandpiper,/species/marsan/IN-PB-SH,"Slender pale sandpiper with a fine, needle-like bill. Note the overall slim and elegant shape, with very long and slender greenish legs: suggests a much smaller Greenshank that’s been to ballet school. In flight appears dark above with broad white stripe up middle of back; long legs project well past tail tip. Usually found singly or mixed in with other waders in varied fresh to brackish wetland habitats, usually with open water. Feeds by wading in water, picking with its bill. Repetitive mellow calls somewhat similar to Greenshank, but rather monotone and with a sharper quality."
124,Common Greenshank,/species/comgre/IN-PB-SH,"Gentle-eyed large wader with a slightly upturned bill. Note overall grayish plumage with white belly and greenish legs. In flight, appears dark above with a broad white stripe up the middle of the back. Slightly larger and lankier than Common Redshank. Usually seen as singles or small groups. Listen for mellow “tewtewtew.” Feeds mainly by striding in water, picking and sweeping with its bill. Breeds across northern Europe and Asia; migrants and wintering birds in Africa, southern Asia and Australia occur in varied wetland habitats."
125,Bay-backed Shrike,/species/babshr1/IN-PB-SH,"Brightly-colored small shrike, reminiscent of Long-tailed Shrike in overall coloration. Black mask, rufous flanks and back, clean white throat, and small size make it distinctive within its range. Prefers open areas, often in dry regions, with scattered vegetation. Often perches up on exposed snags, fenceposts, or telephone lines. Song is a messy jumble of musical warbles, harsh churrs, and sharp twanging notes. Calls include a harsh “jhiir.”"
126,Black-headed Ibis,/species/blhibi1/IN-PB-SH,"A large wader with a white body and bare black head and neck. Males and females look similar and both have grayish tail feathers. It probes into mud and shallow water with its long, down curved black bill, sometimes submerging its entire head. Found primarily around wetlands including agricultural fields and occasionally around coastal areas, but also seen foraging in dry fields and human-modified landscapes."
127,Crested Lark,/species/crelar1/IN-PB-SH,"Medium sized lark with a prominent crest. Separated from the more range-restricted Thekla's Lark by longer bill with straight lower mandible and usually longer and spikier crest. Lots of variation in plumage color, which matches local soil types, but usually grayer and darker than Eurasian Skylark. Short tail and rust-tinged underwings obvious in flight. Found in dry areas with scarce vegetation, especially agricultural land and at roadsides. Song is an often magnificently long and highly impressive series of varied jumbled twitters, trills, warbles, and slurred notes. Often gives a plaintive “ch’wee.”"
128,Zitting Cisticola,/species/zitcis1/IN-PB-SH,"Very small, with a distinctive short, rounded tail with conspicuous spots at the tip. Body sandy-colored below, streaky above. Breeding males have a dark bill and crown. Found in open grasslands, meadows, marshes, and agricultural areas. Most readily detected by its repetitive and monotonous song, given from either a perch or in an undulating song flight. Song varies across wide distribution, ranging from evenly-paced squeaky “tsik, tsik” of African and European birds to the fast dry ticking of Southeast Asian birds."
129,Baya Weaver,/species/baywea1/IN-PB-SH,"A widespread weaver that is known for its nest—a long hanging nest with a bulbous chamber and a narrow tubular entrance. Breeding males have yellow forehead and crown, a dark throat that contrasts with yellow underparts. Nonbreeding males and females are similar except they have buffy colors where breeding males are yellow; also note the dark streaks on the back and the broad buffy eyebrow on females. Juvenile resembles female, but lack the female’s obvious eyebrow. Baya Weavers lack the strongly streaked appearance of Streaked Weavers. Regional variation in plumage exist mainly in the amount of yellow and black in breeding plumage. Occur as flocks, particularly in breeding season. Advertising calls of males are an easy way to detect the species as several males in the flock call together creating a cacophony of a series of rasping chatters followed by a buzzing whistle interspersed with long chatters."
130,Oriental Honey-buzzard,/species/orihob2/IN-PB-SH,"A large raptor of lowland and montane broadleaf and mixed forests, this species is well-known for its tendency to congregate in large flocks of up to thousands during migration. Resident populations inhabit tropical forests from lowlands up into montane areas. While showing considerable plumage variation throughout its range, the combination of an unusually small and slender head, long striped tail, broad wings, and well-striped underwings make this species fairly recognizable across a wide area. True to its name, this species is a raider of wasp and bee nests, although it prefers bee and wasp larvae over their honey."
131,Spotted Owlet,/species/spoowl1/IN-PB-SH,A small uncrested owl with a round head and a short tail. It is grayish-brown overall with white spots above while its underparts are white with brown bars. Note the distinctive white eyebrows and neck-band. Often active at dawn and dusk when it utters a loud “chirurr-chirurr-chirurr” laugh in addition to a variety of high-pitched squeals and whistles. Inhabits all kinds of open habitats but avoids dense forest and wetter regions.
132,Indian Golden Oriole,/species/ingori1/IN-PB-SH,"Males are bright yellow overall save for the black wings and inner tail feathers. Note the yellow patch on the wings, the yellow outer tail feathers, the black stripe through the eye that gives it a masked appearance, and the fleshy pink bill. The female is dull greenish-yellow overall with dirty brown/green wings and a completely yellowish tail. Both males and females have red iris. Most often found feeding in tree canopies either singly or in pairs. They generally give a harsh “krrrrrrrrrrrr” call while feeding. In flight, note its characteristic dipping flight style."
133,Medium Egret,/species/integr1/IN-PB-SH,"A stocky egret that is larger than Eastern Cattle and Little Egrets, but smaller than the Great Egret. Often confusing and difficult to identify, this bird is truly intermediate between potential confusion species. Things to look for include a yellow bill that is shorter than Great Egret but longer than Eastern Cattle Egret, a relatively rounded head, and shorter legs than Great Egret, approaching Eastern Cattle Egret. Like most egret species, associates with all types of water bodies including wet fields, often flocking with other egrets."
134,Common Buzzard,/species/combuz1/IN-PB-SH,"Commonest large hawk in many areas, often seen soaring. Favors woodland and forest edge, farmland with hedges; locally in towns with larger trees and wooded parks. Also hunts over open country, especially moorland and rough grassland. Mainly seen as singles or pairs, circling over fields and woodlands with wings slightly raised. Rather stocky hawk with broad wings and fairly short, square-tipped tail (rounded when spread). Plumage variable but typically has paler breast band, fine dark tail barring (broad dark tail tip on adult)."
135,Tree Pipit,/species/trepip/IN-PB-SH,"Slender and streaked pipit. Feeds on the ground like other pipits, but perches readily in trees or bushes when singing, or alights in tree at end of parachuting song flight. As the name suggests, usually associated with trees (on breeding grounds), but also found in agricultural areas and grassy scrub in winter. All pipits look rather similar and are best identified to species by combination of habitat and voice: Tree Pipit call a high, shrill, buzzy ""tzzz""; song more melodic and varied than Meadow Pipit song."
136,Common Woodshrike,/species/comwoo1/IN-PB-SH,"A medium-sized woodshrike with grayish-brown upperparts, black facial mask, white rump, and gray tail with white outer tail feathers. Bill strongly hooked, dark grayish-brown in color. Underparts white. Similar to Malabar Woodshrike and Large Woodshrike, but generally found in drier forests; also note prominent white supercilium. Usually found in dry forested areas and shrublands. Bright, fast-paced song starts out with two strident “wheeet” notes, followed by a descending series of shorter notes. Calls vary, but usually sound like isolated fragments of song."
137,Gray-breasted Prinia,/species/gybpri1/IN-PB-SH,"A small, relatively short-tailed prinia with a fine black bill. Usually found in scrub forests and undergrowth along forest edges and forest clearings. Breeding birds have a distinctive gray breast band, gray upperparts, and no eyebrow. Nonbreeding birds lack a complete breast band and have a short eyebrow. An active bird that often occurs in flocks. It makes a wide variety of sounds including buzzy songs which it sings from high, exposed perches. Nonbreeding birds are similar to Rufescent Prinia, but Gray-breasted Prinias have a shorter eyebrow, more contrast between the pale throat and darker chest, and a different call."
138,Lesser Whistling-Duck,/species/lewduc1/IN-PB-SH,"A small, well-proportioned, tree-nesting duck. Pale brown overall with a darker brown crown and nape, warmer chestnut underparts, and chestnut-fringed feathers on the back. Note the faint orange-yellow eyering and the dark gray bill and legs. Sexes similar; juveniles duller. A gregarious duck found in shallow water bodies with abundant vegetation. Flies with rapid wingbeats on broad dark wings; note flashing chestnut shoulders and chestnut rump. Call is a wheezy whistling “seasick-seasick."""
139,Scaly-breasted Munia,/species/nutman/IN-PB-SH,"Attractive small songbird of grasslands, gardens, fields, and agricultural areas. Native to India and Southeast Asia, with introduced populations scattered elsewhere around the world. Typical adults dark chestnut-brown above, white below, with fine dark scaly pattern on belly; some populations duller brown. Juveniles plain brown all over with slightly paler underparts. Typically found in small flocks, sometimes mixed with other species of munia."
140,Bonelli's Eagle,/species/boneag2/IN-PB-SH,"Medium-sized, athletically proportioned eagle, with streaked whitish underparts contrasting with dark wings and tail. Juveniles are rufous below, and lack the adult’s broad dark band at the tip of the tail. Found in forests or mountains, sometimes in more open habitats in winter; usually in remote areas. Builds nests on cliffs and ledges, and in caves. Distinctive in flight: note bulging secondaries and narrowness of wing where it meets the body. Usually seen soaring over distant ridgelines, when the shallow “fingers” to its wings are obvious in contrast to the deep fingers of other eagles."
141,Mallard,/species/mallar3/IN-PB-SH,"A large duck, generally common and familiar within its extensive range. Males are distinctive with iridescent green head, yellow bill, chestnut breast, and gray body. Females are mottled brown with orange and black splotches on the bill. Found anywhere with water, including city parks, backyard creeks, and various wetland habitats. Often in flocks, and frequently mixes with other duck species. In North America, females can be tricky to distinguish from American Black Duck, Mottled Duck, and Mexican Duck where ranges overlap. Those species are all darker-bodied than Mallard. A good view of the wing can be helpful, too: white wingbars on the leading and trailing edges of the blue wing patch are bolder on Mallard. Frequently hybridizes with those species, which can be even more confusing. Any bird with extensive white in the tail or curled feathers above the tail has some Mallard genes."
142,Pheasant-tailed Jacana,/species/phtjac1/IN-PB-SH,"An eye-catching waterbird found on lakes and ponds with extensive floating vegetation. Long-tailed breeding adults are striking: the large white wing patch and head contrast sharply with its black body and bright yellow neck patch. Short-tailed wintering adults and juveniles have a brown back, white underparts, and a toned-down version of the breeder's head pattern. Vocalizations include a variety of nasal clucking and purring calls; song, seldom heard, a repeated, ringing “ku-woo.”"
143,Indian Thick-knee,/species/indthk1/IN-PB-SH,"Large, bizarre-looking shorebird with streaky brown plumage and piercing yellow eyes. Black-and-white wing pattern visible in flight. Most active at dusk or at night, often hiding away under shady vegetation by day. Favors dry areas, including fields, thorn forest, and dry riverbeds. Vocal after dark; gives a rapid series of high, sharp ‘kli!’ notes."
144,Little Swift,/species/litswi1/IN-PB-SH,"Small swift with a square-tipped tail, broad outer wings and sharply-demarcated white rump. White on the rump extends to the sides and is visible from below. Note the obvious contrasting white throat. Superficially similar to house-martins, but lacks a white belly. Breeds both in natural cliff settings and in urban areas where it nests on buildings. Very vocal, particularly near the nest, giving a constant descending trill."
145,Booted Eagle,/species/booeag1/IN-PB-SH,"A medium-sized buzzard-like raptor but still unmistakably eagle-shaped, with long fingered primary flight feathers, a long square-shaped tail, and feathered legs (boots) prominent when perched. Two color morphs: pale morphs are distinctively two-toned and contrasting, whereas dark birds can be confused with Black Kites and Marsh Harriers. Look for distinctive pale ""landing lights"" on the shoulders when viewed head-on. Found in forested country with open patches, often in hilly areas where it frequently soars with wings slightly pushed forward."
146,Taiga Flycatcher,/species/taifly1/IN-PB-SH,"Small brown flycatcher with a sharply contrasting black-and-white tail. Breeding male has an orange throat patch surrounded by a faint gray wash. Non-breeding male has darker flanks and far less orange on the throat. Female is cold brown above and dirty-white below. Red-breasted Flycatcher can be very similar; in Taiga, note restricted orange patch and gray throat wash in breeding male and overall colder coloration and darker bill. Voice also differs: Taiga has a more complex song comprised of whistles and trills, and a dry trill, faster than that of Red-breasted. Breeds in forested areas, favoring coniferous and mixed deciduous tracts with clearings and waterways. Winters in various wooded or shrubby habitats."
147,Black Francolin,/species/blkfra/IN-PB-SH,"Strikingly patterned male is unmistakable with his jet-black face and breast, white cheek patch, dark rust-brown collar, and bright white spots. Brownish female has a small orange nape patch, pale throat, and dense black-and-white markings all over the body; compare with larger Gray Francolin. Occurs in dry grasslands, agricultural land, and weedy fields. Shier than other francolins; more often heard than seen. Usually solitary or in pairs. Male call is a peculiar, metallic-sounding “keek, keek, kek-ke-kek.” Native to Asia, from Turkey east to far eastern India and northern Myanmar; introduced to Hawaii."
148,Large Gray Babbler,/species/lagbab2/IN-PB-SH,"Large gray-brown babbler with piercing yellow eyes. Can be confused with Jungle Babbler, with which it sometimes associates; look for strong dark lores and a darker bill. Favors scrubby areas, forest edge, and open dry forests. Like many other related babblers, typically hops around on the ground in flocks. Chatters persistently; the most common call is a loud, nasal “kaaa-kaaa-kaaa”."
149,Peregrine Falcon,/species/perfal/IN-PB-SH,"Sleek, fast-flying large falcon. Always look for a grayish back in adults, long wings that almost reach the tail tip, and powerful but slender build. Dark mark below each eye varies in shape and size. Juveniles are more heavily patterned below than adults, and can be quite brownish above. Patterning varies considerably across a wide global range, with back color ranging from pale gray in Central Asian “Red-capped” to slaty-blue across much of northern Eurasia North America, to almost black in Asian “Shaheen.” Chases prey down at high speeds with continuous powerful wingbeats. Becoming increasingly common in parts of range, especially in cities, where they can nest on tall buildings and feed on pigeons. Adaptable, and can be seen in a wide range of habitats; often encountered in areas with steep cliffs, as well as around coastal mudflats and open areas with shorebirds."
150,Yellow-eyed Babbler,/species/yeebab1/IN-PB-SH,"An odd-looking babbler which looks and behaves like a prinia on steroids. Brown above and white below with rufous wingtips. Red eyering is unique. Scrambles about in reedbeds, scrub, field edges, and grassy meadows in small flocks and pairs. Scales stems like a parrotbill and hangs acrobatically like a tit or leaf warbler. Strident, melodic song has a somewhat hoarse, nasal quality. Calls include repeated descending whistles, energetic chattering, and dry chittering."
151,Dusky Crag-Martin,/species/duscrm1/IN-PB-SH,"An overall dark brown swallow with paler underparts. It has a square tail with a white spot on each tail feather, making a white speckled band of sorts. Young birds have paler underparts. Mostly seen flying in pairs or small flocks along cliffs, but sometimes also near tall buildings. Flight action generally slower than Barn Swallow’s, but can wheel and loop at quick speed."
152,Plum-headed Parakeet,/species/plhpar1/IN-PB-SH,"A brilliantly-colored parakeet; males have a plum-colored head while females have grayish-blue head. Endemic to the Indian subcontinent where it can occur in any well-wooded area outside NE India and the high Himalayas. Similar to the largely non-overlapping Blossom-headed Parakeet, but shows a darker shade of plum or gray on the head and a white-tipped tail (not yellow). They also lack the red shoulder patch seen on Blossom-headed females. A yellow upper bill separates it from all overlapping parakeets. Call is a distinctive, short, and high-pitched “tui.”"
153,Ashy-crowned Sparrow-Lark,/species/ascspl1/IN-PB-SH,"A small, stocky bird with a heavy, finch-like bill. Males have a gray head that contrasts with a black eye-stripe, and black on the collar, throat, and underparts. Females are pale brown with weak streaks on the head, back, and underparts. Similar to Black-crowned Sparrow-Lark, but Ashy-crowned males are told apart by the gray on the head. Females are difficult to distinguish. Inhabits dry scrub, fields, and rocky country. The song is often given in display flight, and consists of monotone whistles interspersed with buzzy notes."
154,Sulphur-bellied Warbler,/species/subwar2/IN-PB-SH,"Brown-and-yellow leaf warbler without a wingbar. Breeds in stony, bushy, semi-arid slopes in mountain ranges flanking the Tibetan Plateau. Winters primarily in rocky scrub almost throughout the Indian peninsula. Resembles Tickell’s Leaf Warbler, but has a browner cheek and dirtier underparts, and often has a bright yellow eyebrow that contrasts with a dull brownish-yellow throat. Very partial to the ground, unlike Tickell’s, and often seen creeping on rocks, walls, or tree trunks like a nuthatch."
155,Tickell's Blue Flycatcher,/species/tibfly3/IN-PB-SH,"Attractive medium-sized flycatcher with blue upperparts and orange-and-white underparts, with the most orange on the chest and the throat. Male is more intensely-colored overall than the female. Smaller-billed profile, less extensive orange, and paler face distinguish this species from male Hill Blue Flycatcher. Extensive orange on the throat separates Tickell’s from Blue-throated Flycatcher. Favors open hill forests as well as forest edge, particularly in drier, scrubby areas, often close to water. Both sexes give a pleasant high-pitched tinkling song. Calls include dry rattles and metallic clinks."
156,Osprey,/species/osprey/IN-PB-SH,"Large, mostly white raptor that cruises over lakes, rivers, and coastal waterways in search of fish. Impressively widespread: found on every continent except Antarctica. Mostly white head and underparts; dark brown back. In flight, holds wings with a kink in the wrist (shaped like an ""M""). Stick nests are conspicuous on top of channel markers, utility poles and high platforms near water. Often seen plunging feet-first into water from high in the air to grab fish."
157,Imperial Eagle,/species/impeag1/IN-PB-SH,"Very large; dark-brown body of adult contrasts with pale head and nape. Similar to Golden Eagle but with a shorter tail and white shoulders that can be hard to spot. The underwings are dark with low contrast. Immatures are strikingly different, sandy brown with prominent streaks and a pale rump contrasting with the dark tail and dark flight feathers. Breeds in forested areas intermixed with steppes and agricultural areas, where often seen perched on pylons. Winters in open habitats, including cropland."
158,Brown-capped Pygmy Woodpecker,/species/bncwoo3/IN-PB-SH,"Small woodpecker of open forest and forest edge. Note size, pale eyes, and broad-striped head pattern. Darkness of the crown varies; palest in northern and peninsular India and darkest in Sri Lanka. Where it overlaps with Gray-capped Woodpecker, note the more “blocky” head pattern, pale eyes, and white-spotted tail of Brown-capped. Gives a short chittering trill that rises and falls quickly."
159,Black Stork,/species/blasto1/IN-PB-SH,"Adult distinctive: glossy black overall with white belly, very long pointed red bill and reddish legs. Juvenile similar, but duller overall. Breeds in swampy coniferous and mixed forests, where rather shy; builds a bulky stick nest high in trees. In mountainous regions also nests on cliffs. Wintering and migrating birds can be found in grasslands, agricultural fields, and on the margins of lakes and rivers. Flies with neck and legs outstretched, and strong, deep wingbeats interspersed with glides; also soars on thermals."
160,Asian Green Bee-eater,/species/grnbee3/IN-PB-SH,"A small, dainty bee-eater of open woodlands, farmland, and sparse human habitation. Mainly green with a bluish throat, slender black eye mask and throat band, rufous or slightly rusty crown and back of the neck, and central tail streamers. Juveniles are duller than adults and lack the long tail feathers. In flight, note the rusty underwing with a black trailing edge. Flies gracefully as it catches insects and other prey. Calls are a series of gentle liquid trills or more staccato notes."
161,Eurasian Wryneck,/species/eurwry/IN-PB-SH,"Bizarre and unmistakable small gray woodpecker. Note broad black stripe down middle of crown and back. Cryptic plumage and sluggish habits make it easily overlooked. Favors open country with scattered trees, orchards, farmland; nests in tree cavities. Feeds mostly on the ground, probing with its long tongue for ants; hops with deliberate, rather jerky motions, often twitching its tail and turning its head. Song is a rising series of high, piercing notes, similar to that of a falcon."
162,Bengal Bushlark,/species/benbus1/IN-PB-SH,"Small, stocky brown terrestrial bird with a relatively short tail. Note stout bill with slightly downcurved upper edge; also streaky back, speckled chest, buffy-pale underparts, and rufous panel in the wing. May be confused with other bushlarks with which it overlaps in range; averages darker, with less contrast between upperparts and underparts. Inhabits open plains and fields, sometimes with scattered shrubs and bushes. Gives buzzy repetitive song in flight, on the ground, or from a perch."
163,Variable Wheatear,/species/varwhe1/IN-PB-SH,"Well-named; black-and-white pattern of the males is striking but varies considerably. Brownish female is not as noticeably variable, but also can be considerably darker or lighter-colored. Note black-and-white tail in all plumages. Inhabits arid and barren foothills, plateaus, valleys, and mountains, where it forages from a perch and on the ground."
164,Indian Paradise-Flycatcher,/species/aspfly1/IN-PB-SH,"A graceful looking flycatcher, the adult male sport a long ribbonlike tail. The males occur in two color morphs cinnamon and white. Both color morphs sport a glossy black head with blue ring around the eye, but white morph is entirely white below while the cinnamon morph has cinnamon upperparts and tail, and dirty white underparts. The females are cinnamon above with a grayish throat, a shorter tail, and they lack the male’s blue eyering. They make short aerial sallies after insects, usually returning to the same perch. Occasionally descends to ground to pull apart insects. Chiefly found in wooded habitats. Their call is a harsh “shreew.”"
165,Long-tailed Minivet,/species/lotmin1/IN-PB-SH,"Typical colorful minivet with red-and-black males and gray-and-yellow females. Male is very similar to Scarlet and Short-billed Minivets, but has a lumpy fork on the wing instead of a jagged ‘lightning bolt’ as in those two species. Female can be identified by a similarly simple wing patch and less extensive yellow on the head than Short-billed and Scarlet Minivets. Both sexes average longer-tailed than similar species. Usually found in pairs or small flocks in mid- to high-altitude forests. Gives a pleasant “dee-dee” and a rolling “pr’wee, pr’wee!”."
166,Ashy Drongo,/species/ashdro1/IN-PB-SH,"A slim, medium-sized drongo with bright red eyes and gray plumage that is almost black in the western parts of its range and quite pale in the eastern parts of its range; eastern birds also often have an oval-shaped pale facial patch. It has a long slim tail with a deep fork. Common in wooded habitats where it sallies for insects and aggressively chases other birds that may compete for food or nectar. Most birds migrate south every winter. Similar to Black Drongo, but slimmer and usually in different habitats. Calls include harsh and sweet notes, and can mimic some bird species poorly."
167,Blyth's Reed Warbler,/species/blrwar1/IN-PB-SH,"Field identification challenging. Pay attention to short wings (short primary projection), gray-brown tones to upperparts and long, dark-tipped bill with a flat forehead. Song is varied with many repetitions and lots of mimicry; call is a high-pitched and loud ""tek."" Found in forest edges, bushes, marsh edges, and parks, but not particularly associated with water. Usually sings from bushes and trees, not in reeds or herbage."
168,Indian Scops-Owl,/species/insowl1/IN-PB-SH,"Medium-sized scops-owl with prominent ear tufts and dark eyes. Coloration variable, ranging from gray to brown, but dark eyes, thin black border around the facial disc, and lightly streaked underparts remain constant. Gives bouncy amphibian-like barks at changing intervals. Inhabits forests, forest edges, parks, and gardens from lowlands up into foothill and montane regions."
169,Common Babbler,/species/combab3/IN-PB-SH,"Faintly streaked warm buffy-brown babbler. Dark eyes and and pale throat separate this species from the similar Striated Babbler. A common and familiar city and town bird throughout much of its range; A bird of scrubby plains, open forests, forest edges, and overgrown cultivation. Whickers, trills, squeaks, and chirps loudly as flocks hop about on the ground and in low undergrowth."
170,Yellow-bellied Prinia,/species/yebpri1/IN-PB-SH,"Brightly-colored for a prinia, this is a species of lowland fields, wetlands, and meadows. Dark above, yellowish below, with a white throat, eyering, and thin stripe between eye and bill. Typically found singly or in pairs. Forages low in vegetation, flicking its long tail constantly. Hill Prinia is larger, lacks yellow on the belly, and has a longer and more prominent white supercilium. Song is a distinctive, a cascading series of twitters following a buzzy introductory note."
171,Striated Babbler,/species/strbab1/IN-PB-SH,"Brown babbler with a finely streaked back and crown. Also note bright yellow eyes and faint pale “moustache.” Social, usually encountered in flocks as they clamber about in lowland reedbeds, wet grassy areas, and scrub. Gives sparrow-like “chirrup” and sharp “pee-cheer.”"
172,Brahminy Kite,/species/brakit1/IN-PB-SH,"A medium-sized raptor with a rounded tail unlike other kites. Adults are unmistakable with a white head and breast contrasting with otherwise brick brown plumage. Juveniles are a darker brownish-black with a paler head and prominent white patches under the wings. Usually associated with both inland and coastal wetlands in tropical Asia, but it is largely restricted to coastal wetlands in Australia where it is alternately known as “Red-backed Sea Eagle.” Call is a distinctive nasal, drawn out, “Kyeeerrh.”"
173,Delicate Prinia,/species/delpri1/IN-PB-SH,"Tiny, disproportionately long-tailed, active, and vocal. The upperparts are gray-brown with heavy dark streaking, the underparts are pale, and each tail feather shows both pale and dark tips. Generally found in rather moist habitats within arid zones, including field margins, riparian woodland, scrub, gardens, and wetlands; can be quite numerous. Very vocal, especially in spring. The song is a rattling series of dry chirps, subtly different from the slower-paced song of Graceful Prinia. Males often sing from obvious perches. Visually extremely similar to Graceful Prinia, but there is little overlap in range. In any areas of overlap, best separated by song, but Delicate is also slightly longer- and narrower-tailed and browner."
174,Streak-throated Swallow,/species/sttswa2/IN-PB-SH,"A small brown-black swallow with a short tail and comparatively weak flight. The forehead, crown, and back of the neck are dull chestnut with faint dark streaks. The back is glossy deep blue with a few narrow whitish streaks; the rump is pale brown and is more prominent in flight. The wings and tail are blackish-brown, and the tail almost square-ended. Underparts are buffy white with blackish-brown streaks, especially the chin, throat, and upper breast. Juvenile is duller and browner than adult, with buff feather edges and faint streaks on underparts. Found mostly as individuals in mixed swallow flocks; different, weaker flight action is characteristic."
175,Green Warbler,/species/grnwar1/IN-PB-SH,"Nondescript leaf warbler with two whitish wing bars (often only one visible), dull to bright greenish upperparts, a yellow wash usually restricted to the face, and a pale orange lower bill. Breeds in forest in the Caucasus mountains. Winters primarily in southern India, where it largely overlaps with the similar-looking Greenish Warbler. Although separable from Greenish Warbler by its greener upperparts, yellow on face, and the second wingbar (when present), Green is best identified by its loud, fast, trisyllabic “chi-su-wi” call."
176,Blue-tailed Bee-eater,/species/btbeat1/IN-PB-SH,"Elegant, slender bird of open country, frequently seen in flight or perched on exposed snags or telephone wires. Adult green overall, with blue tail, thin black mask, and rufous throat; bright rufous underwings visible in flight. Juvenile similar but paler, with tannish throat and shorter tail, lacking the adult's elongated central tail feathers. Flying bird has distinctive shape, with broad, sharply pointed wings, long tail, and long bill. Nests colonially in sandbanks. Voice a sweet, clipped “cheer-it,” sometimes given in series."
177,European Roller,/species/eurrol1/IN-PB-SH,"Spectacular and distinctive: overall brilliant blue, with a rusty back and a stout, crowlike bill; juvenile plumage duller overall. Favors open and semiopen country with scattered trees and wooded patches; often takes larger insects, such as grasshoppers. Mostly seen singly or in small groups, perched on prominent perches, such as bare snags and wires, as well as on the ground. Quiet outside of the breeding season, when birds give harsh rasping calls."
178,Pallas's Fish-Eagle,/species/pafeag1/IN-PB-SH,"A pale-headed raptor of inland marshes and lakes. Tends to be uncommon and thinly distributed throughout its range. Adult is dark brown above with a paler belly and dirty-gray head. When in flight from below, a broad white band on the dark tail is the most eye-catching feature. Juveniles have an all-dark tail, but have two bright white panels on the undersides of the wingtips; this patterning can be similar to that of some kites, but the fish-eagle is much larger, with a longer-winged and comparatively shorter-tailed profile."
179,Pied Cuckoo,/species/piecuc1/IN-PB-SH,"Black-and-white cuckoo with a spiffy crest (also known as the “Jacobin Cuckoo” for its smartly attired appearance). Some southern African birds exhibit a dark morph: all black with a white wing patch. Found in lowland and foothill open forests and plains, often in thorny growth. Song is a widely-spaced series of somewhat hoarse whistled notes. Lays its eggs in the nests of babblers, bulbuls, and shrikes."
180,Common Grasshopper Warbler,/species/cogwar1/IN-PB-SH,"Extremely skulky warbler. Plumage dark gray-brown overall with wide black streaks on back; also note long undertail coverts with big dark centers. Favors damp grassy thickets, heaths, and other rank shrubby habitats, often near water. Very skulking, and rarely seen unless singing. Sings from perch in grass or low bush, mainly late in the day (sometimes at night): a prolonged, insectlike, reeling trill. Calls include a high-pitched “pik.”"
181,Tricolored Munia,/species/trimun/IN-PB-SH,"Small, finchlike bird of weedy and grassy areas in tropical lowlands. Often in small flocks, which associate readily with seedeaters and grassquits. Adult is handsome and striking with rusty upperparts. Black head and underparts are cut by a broad white swath from flanks across the lower breast. Note stout gray bill. Juvenile notably plain, buffy brown overall with stout bluish-gray bill. Note the pointed tail, unlike seedeaters and grassquits. Native to Asia and spreading in New World as an escaped cage bird."
182,Yellow-throated Sparrow,/species/chspet1/IN-PB-SH,"A small, drab, unstreaked sparrow with one, sometimes two prominent white wingbars. Gray-brown above, pale brown to whitish on underparts. Male has an indistinct eyebrow, an inconspicuous pale yellow spot on throat, and light chestnut on shoulders. Juvenile resembles female. The familiar call is a distinctive “chilp” that it gives mostly while perching high. Inhabits light forests, scrub jungles, villages, and cultivated areas."
183,Common Hawk-Cuckoo,/species/cohcuc1/IN-PB-SH,"A medium-sized bird that resembles a Shikra in plumage. Males have ashy-gray upperparts, white underparts with rufous streaking and barring, a broadly barred tail, and a distinct yellow eye rim. Females and juveniles are browner with bolder streaking below. During their breeding season males produce a loud, repetitive three note call. Common Hawk-Cuckoos feed mainly on insects and are specialised feeders that can handle hairy caterpillars. The species is arboreal and rarely descends to the ground. Mainly a brood parasite of babblers. Found in gardens, groves, and deciduous and semi-evergreen forests."
184,Crested Serpent-Eagle,/species/crseag1/IN-PB-SH,"A rather large, heavily built eagle with a dark, white-tipped bushy crest that gives it a distinctive large-headed look. When raised in alarm, the crest frames the whole face, highlighting the bare yellow lores and eyes, making the head look larger and fiercer. The rufous-brown underparts have neatly arranged dark-edged bold white spots. In flight, shows broad rounded wings with a wide black trailing edge. Juvenile predominantly white with dark streaks below; also note dark mask. Commonly seen perched upright in well-wooded areas, with wingtips nearly covering the broad white sub-terminal band on the tail. Its 1-3 note scream is often heard in the forest."
185,Yellow-crowned Woodpecker,/species/yecwoo1/IN-PB-SH,"Medium-sized woodpecker with a densely-spotted black-and-white back and blotchy brown-and-white underparts. Female has an all-golden crown; male has a red forecrown. Where it overlaps with Brown-fronted Woodpecker, note blotchier brown striping on the underparts, pale vent, and duller crown. Gives sharp notes and a high descending rattle. Favors dry arid areas with relatively open foliage."
186,Small Minivet,/species/smamin1/IN-PB-SH,"The smallest of the minivets. Males have slaty gray crown, cheeks, and back. Throat and wings black, tail black with pale yellow edges. Breast orange, gradually fading into yellowish-white underparts. Black wings show a patch of orange. Female is duller than male, with light gray upperparts, cheeks and crown; dark gray wings; white throat; and light yellow underparts. Both males and females show an orange rump. Usually seen in small flocks, frequently uttering high-pitched “swee swee” call as they continuously move around feeding on insects, sometimes catching them mid-air like flycatchers. Inhabits various forested habitats, especially thorny jungles, scrub patches, and open dry forest."
187,Black-headed Cuckooshrike,/species/bkhcus1/IN-PB-SH,"Male has dark slaty-gray head, neck, and upper breast; rest of the body is pale gray, with white on the belly. Wings darker than mantle. Female lacks the black hood, and has a whitish supercilium, brownish-gray upperparts with lightly barred back and rump, and buff-white underparts with wide brown bars. Juvenile is similar to female, but upperparts barred white. Immature similar to female. Song is a series of clear, loud whistles: “pee-pe-pe-pe-pe-twe-twee.” Some notes can be omitted, or additional notes added."
188,Thick-billed Flowerpecker,/species/thbflo1/IN-PB-SH,"Dull gray-brown flowerpecker with streaked white underparts. Unremarkable; bill isn’t all that noticeably thick, but combination of pale vent, striped throat, and (in some subspecies) strongly streaked underparts serve to identify this wide-ranging and variable species. Like many other flowerpeckers, often associated with mistletoe, but can be found in a variety of forest types and elevations. Often heard giving a hard, slightly wet “tsip!”"
189,Red Collared-Dove,/species/recdov1/IN-PB-SH,"Medium-sized dove of open spaces with trees and bushes. Male is red with a bluish-gray head and female is brown overall. Both sexes have a dark collar. Female may be confused with other collared-doves, but is smaller with a shorter tail. Often forages in pairs, but may congregate in large flocks, particularly in agricultural fields where seeds have been spilled. Song is a hoarse and muffled-sounding series of three or four hoots."
190,Brahminy Starling,/species/brasta1/IN-PB-SH,"A small fawn-colored starling with a long wispy crest that usually lies limp over the back of its head, but the feathers on its cheek and upper breast stand up and away from its cheek. Its upperparts are gray and the dark tail is tipped in white. Note the yellow bill with a blue base. Often seen in small family groups, feeding on fruits and nectar as well as insects on the ground or in the trees. They have a wide repertoire of calls and are also given to mimicking other species."
191,Barred Buttonquail,/species/barbut1/IN-PB-SH,"Tiny rotund, short-tailed bird, scarcely larger than a sparrow; like a diminutive partridge or quail but only distantly related. Brown with scaly streaking above, extensive black barring on the chest (more extensive on the female), and rich tawny flanks. Extremely difficult to detect, moving about invisibly in dense weedy vegetation in fields, forest edges, and farmland. Flying birds have whirring flight, show contrast between dark flight feathers and paler coverts. Courting females give sonorous, booming calls from dense vegetation."
192,Streaked Weaver,/species/strwea2/IN-PB-SH,"Male in breeding plumage has a golden-yellow cap covering the forehead and crown, and a blackish face and throat. Dark brown above with rusty edges to feathers, and buffy white below with longitudinal dark streaks on the flanks and upper breast. Non-breeding males, females, and juveniles more similar to other weavers; they have a yellowish buff eye-brow that extends down around the back of the face, streaky flanks, and dark brown upperparts with long streaks on the back. More partial to water than Baya Weaver, nesting around reedbeds in wetlands. Noisy near breeding colonies. Males make a continuous chirpy “cheer” or “teaur” call, not as loud as Baya Weaver’s."
193,Indian Cuckoo,/species/indcuc1/IN-PB-SH,"Sleek and slender gray-and-white cuckoo. Loud, far-carrying song is unique: four hooting notes, often likened to “onemore-boh-tul!” or “crossword-puh-zuhl.” Adult is similar in size and coloration to Oriental, Himalayan, and Common Cuckoos, but note dark eyes and darker back and wings. Juvenile patchy-looking, often showing a whitish crown and collar and white edging to the wing feathers. Favors forests, forest edges, and parklands. Lays its eggs in the nests of a wide range of birds, including magpies, shrikes, and drongos."
194,Indian Pitta,/species/indpit1/IN-PB-SH,"A colorful stubby-tailed bird, also known as “Navrang,” translated as “nine colors.” Colors are most striking when the bird is in flight. This bird has long, strong legs and a stout bill, a buffy crown with a black stripe in the middle, a black eye-stripe, and and buffy underparts with bright red on the vent. Upperparts are green, with a blue shoulder patch. It is usually seen foraging on forest floors with thick undergrowth, catching insects in leaf litter. This bird is vocal, giving its characteristic two-noted whistle call at dusk and dawn."
195,Greater Painted-Snipe,/species/grpsni1/IN-PB-SH,"A medium-sized, stunningly plumaged shorebird of grassy fields and marshes. Both sexes have a bright white “comma” around the eye and white underparts that extend up in an arc above the shoulder. As in phalaropes, the male is much duller than the female. The female has a bright reddish-brown head and greenish-tinged back and wings; the more cryptically colored male has a light brown head and brown upperparts dappled with orange and tan spots, thus more similar to snipe. Displaying female gives a series of owl-like hoots."
196,Short-toed Snake-Eagle,/species/shteag1/IN-PB-SH,"Large, slightly ungainly raptor with long and very broad wings, a shortish tail, and a conspicuously big head. Pale belly and underwings contrast with the darker head in most adults, but juveniles have pale heads. All age groups have a tendency to look a bit disheveled. On perched birds look for the owl-like face and unfeathered legs. Hunts over open areas, spending lots of time hovering with rowing wingbeats into the wind."
197,Asian Openbill,/species/asiope1/IN-PB-SH,"A relatively small stork species with a grayish to white body and black wings and tail with a hint of gloss. The Asian Openbill gets its name from a distinctive gap in the dull grayish yellow bill. Note the pinkish legs. Asian Openbills inhabit wetland habitats including shallow marshes, flooded agricultural fields, and lakes. From a distance they could be confused with herons, but they can be clearly distinguished from herons by their feeding habits—wading slowly through shallow water. Soars frequently, often in large dense flocks; note extended neck, unlike retracted neck of herons and egrets."
198,Crested Bunting,/species/crebun1/IN-PB-SH,"Spiky upright crest distinguishes this large bunting from similar species. Male is glossy black with bright chestnut wings. Female is streaky dirt-brown with slightly duller wings. A hill specialist, often found on rocky, bushy hillsides and terraced fields. Generally in pairs or small flocks. Short song begins with a few buzzy notes and ends with mellow whistling. Call is hard “chik.”"
199,Red Junglefowl,/species/redjun/IN-PB-SH,"This “original chicken” is smaller than its domestic descendants, and is widespread throughout South and Southeast Asia; can also be found as an introduced species in many regions around the world (especially prevalent on many Pacific Islands, including Hawaii). In its introduced range and some areas of its native range it has interbred widely with feral and domestic chickens, producing intermediate hybrids. Many of these birds cannot be distinguished from genuine wild-type birds. Within native range calls are useful for ID: the wild male’s crowing is hoarse and choked off towards the end, unlike the loud, vibrant calls of the domestic rooster."
200,Common Iora,/species/comior1/IN-PB-SH,"Breeding adult males are black above and rich yellow below with white wingbars. In nonbreeding plumage the upperparts are greenish-yellow, but the wings are still black with white wingbars. The female is similar in appearance to a nonbreeding male. These birds are quite vocal and can produce a wide variety of calls. The most commonly heard is the whistle “twiii tuiii twiiii.” Apart from this, it utters variable “chirrs” and chattering. The song is a trilled “wheeeee-tee.” Common Iora are frequently seen in wooded areas, scrub, and cultivated lands."
201,Common Rosefinch,/species/comros/IN-PB-SH,"Medium-sized, dumpy finch with a stubby bill. Male are distinctive with a red head, breast, and rump, brown eye-mask, and white belly. The amount of red varies with age. Females and juveniles are a rather unprepossessing, uniform brown inviting confusion with female House Sparrows; note the two pale wingbars. Breeds at both low and high elevations in deciduous scrub, meadows, and marsh edges as well as clearings in forest. Far-carrying, whistled, typically 3-note song is memorable."
202,Glossy Ibis,/species/gloibi/IN-PB-SH,"Long, curved bill. Adults mostly dark with iridescent green and reddish tones. Very thin white border surrounding the dark facial skin. Dark eyes. Usually gregarious, it is found mainly in salty marshes and shallow wetlands. Unmistakable in most of its range, though American birds are best distinguished from White-faced Ibis by distribution and facial pattern."
203,Chestnut-tailed Starling,/species/chtsta2/IN-PB-SH,"Pale-headed starling with dark-tipped wings and an orangish belly and rump. Bill is distinctively colorful: blue with a yellow tip. Inhabits open forests and forest edge, as well as agricultural areas and village outskirts. Like other starlings, social and raucous, often flocking together while noisily churring and whistling. Frequently perches up on exposed perches such as snags and utility lines, but also forages extensively on the ground. Native to southern Asia; introduced to Taiwan."
204,Jungle Bush-Quail,/species/jubqua1/IN-PB-SH,"A small, plump terrestrial bird, roughly spherical in shape. Identified by its rusty throat and rusty-and-white eyebrow. Males have barred underparts while females have uniform pinkish cinnamon underparts. Found in dry stony scrub jungles and dry grasslands. Often seen in groups of 2–7 (but can occur in groups up to 20). Generally secretive until flushed when it suddenly bursts into flight, flying with weak whirring wingbeats low over the ground before quickly dropping into cover. Feeds on grass,seeds, and small insects."
205,White-capped Bunting,/species/chbbun1/IN-PB-SH,"Male’s elegant black-and-white facial pattern is unique. Female is plain, streaky brown all over with faint white eye-ring, a weak hint of the male’s facial pattern, and a small white spot on the “ears”. Breeds in rocky gullies, valleys, and hillsides at middle to upper elevations; winters at lower altitudes, in fields, scrubland, and open dry forest. Song is a series of twanging buzzy pulses: “TZI-TZI-TZI-TZI-TZI.”"
206,Tickell's Thrush,/species/ticthr1/IN-PB-SH,"Both sexes of this thrush are fairly uniformly-colored: the male is predominantly blue-gray and the female is warm brown with a slight buffy wash to the underparts. May be confused with Indian Blackbird in southwestern wintering range, but both sexes are paler and smaller than their respective counterparts of that species. Breeds in open forest and forest edge in hilly and submontane areas; winters in similar habitat at lower altitudes. Sings melodic warbling and buzzing phrases; also gives a short bubbly bursts of “chup” notes."
207,Pale Martin,/species/pasmar1/IN-PB-SH,"Small dull swallow, brown above and white below, with a sharp brown chest band. Nearly identical to Bank Swallow, with which it breeds sympatrically and overlaps on migration, but look for a slightly less well-defined lower border to the cheek patch and a slightly paler, more diffuse breast band. Voice also differs subtly, Pale gives primarily series of dry notes with a more trilling quality than Bank Swallow’s. Similarly picky in its nesting locales, limited only to sandy hillsides and banks, often near a water source."
208,Ruff,/species/ruff/IN-PB-SH,"A bizarre and unique shorebird. Medium-sized with fairly short, slightly drooped bill. Leg color varies from dull greenish to bright orange; bill can be entirely dark or mostly orange. Plumage highly variable, especially breeding males, which have fancy neck ruffs that can be black, white, buffy, reddish-brown, or any combination thereof. Females and nonbreeding birds can be confusing, usually plain grayish-brown overall, sometimes with blotchy markings on the neck and belly. Juveniles are bright buffy with neat scaly patterning on the upperparts. Flight often rather lazy, with deep floppy wingbeats; note white underwings, white sides to rump, and feet projecting well past tail. Males are much larger than females. Breeds in bogs and wet grassy meadows across northern Eurasia; winters mainly in Africa but also across India and Southeast Asia. Migrants occur in almost any wetland habitat, from reservoirs and fields to coastal mudflats. Feeds by probing and picking, often while in shallow water. Rare but regular vagrant to North America, usually single birds found among flocks of yellowlegs."
209,Eurasian Griffon,/species/eurgri1/IN-PB-SH,"Massive tricolored vulture with whitish head and neck, pale brown body, and contrasting dark flight feathers. Juveniles similar but with a pale brown rather than white neck ruff. Nests in colonies on cliff ledges; often seen in loose flocks soaring over valleys and mountainsides but always in search of updrafts and thermals. Still the commonest vulture over much of its breeding range. Some populations are resident while others are highly migratory."
210,Brown-headed Gull,/species/bnhgul1/IN-PB-SH,"The pale button eyes of this gull give it a somewhat fearsome appearance. Breeding adult’s head is the color of milk chocolate, lightening towards the bill. Non-breeding and first-winter birds have a dark ear patch and faint traces of the dark hood. All plumages may be confused with smaller Black-headed Gull, but note pale eyes and more extensive black on the primaries in all plumages. Breeds on high-altitude lakes on the Tibetan Plateau and winters on marshes, estuaries, lakes and rivers, most often in coastal areas."
211,Black-breasted Weaver,/species/benwea1/IN-PB-SH,"Male distinctive in breeding plumage, with extensive yellow forehead and black face, nape, and upper breast. Dark brown above with blackish streaks and dirty white below. Often the black on breast can be replaced with a pale throat, forming a black necklace, partial or complete, of variable width. Non-breeding males often show a much reduced breast band with dark patches on either side. Female and juvenile are brown and white, like females of other weavers, with a buffy eyebrow above a thin, dark eye-stripe. Nests communally. Breeding song is a series of low-pitched buzzes, not as loud as Baya Weaver’s. Mostly found close to water, near tall grass and reeds."
212,Gray-hooded Warbler,/species/gyhwar2/IN-PB-SH,"Delicately beautiful small warbler with a greenish back, lemon-yellow underparts, a cinder-gray head, and bright white eyebrow stripes. Somewhat similar to Yellow-bellied Warbler, but note yellow instead of white throat. Forages actively in the upper levels of broadleaf and mixed montane forest, often in open patches. Sometimes descends to lower elevations in the non-breeding season, often turning up in foothill forest edges and gardens. Song is a high-pitched “tchi-tchi-cheeseewee-cheeseewee.” Calls are high, thin double notes."
213,Blue-throated Barbet,/species/bltbar2/IN-PB-SH,"A common inhabitant of lowland and foothill tropical forests, where it sings brightly but often unseen from the canopy; listen for its repeated 3- or 4-syllabled ‘took-o-rrook!’ Tends to be more common in edge areas and degraded forests than other barbets. Bright green with a blue throat, a red-and-yellow crown, and a heavy, pale-based bill. Birds at the northern and western parts of this species’ range have a black brow, while southern birds don’t."
214,Yellow-bellied Fairy-Fantail,/species/yebfan1/IN-PB-SH,"An active little bird with a bright yellow belly and a pale-tipped fan-like tail. Most common in foothill and submontane broadleaf forests, where it forages energetically and acrobatically in the middle and lower levels, often with fulvettas, warblers, and other small passerines in mixed-species foraging flocks. Very similar in shape to fantails but much smaller, and actually more closely related to tits. Song is a series of high “tsit” notes interspersed with twitters and trills. Call is often repeated at length, akin to a song, but much simpler, a series of high “tsip” notes."
215,Tawny-bellied Babbler,/species/tabbab1/IN-PB-SH,"Bright orange-brown babbler, brighter-colored than any similar babblers. Stays away from dense mature forests, instead favoring forest edges, open woodlands, dense scrub, and grassy areas interspersed with trees. Song is a short series of moderately-spaced high sibilant whistles. Call repertoire ranges from high thin notes to noisy yapping."
216,Black-chinned Babbler,/species/blcbab2/IN-PB-SH,"Small buffy babbler with a black throat and lores. Social, often occurring in flocks with other species. Forages close to or on the ground in open forest, shrubby edge, and overgrown gardens and orchards. Song is a monotone or slightly ascending series of piping whistles. Calls include a sped-up version of the song and harsh churring."
217,Small Niltava,/species/smanil1/IN-PB-SH,"Size distinguishes this species from other niltavas; coloration is quite similar to Large Niltava, which is double the size. Male Small Niltava is bright blue with the brightest patches on the shoulder and forehead. Female is brown with a white eyering and a rufous tail and wingtips. Forages in the lower and middle levels of hilly and montane forests, usually singly. Listen for its distinctive song, a cleanly descending “wee-dee-dee.”"
218,Slaty-blue Flycatcher,/species/slbfly2/IN-PB-SH,"Male is unique dark gray-blue above with a white throat, thin black chinstrap, and white undersides and tail base (often flashed when in flight). Female is plainer, dark brown above and lighter tan brown below, with a rufous-tinged tail; weak contrast and overall dark coloration distinguish her from other brown female flycatchers. Breeds in high-altitude and foothill forests and descends downhill to winter in scrubby areas, often in second growth. Often forages close to the ground. Song consists of an endless series of high, whistled “chee-chee-wit!”, often given from a low, hidden perch. Also gives hard, resonant “tak” notes."
219,Tawny Pipit,/species/tawpip1/IN-PB-SH,"Large, slim, sandy-colored pipit with a long and broad eyebrow, a prominent dark area in front of the eye, sparsely streaked back and breast, and a long and pointed pinkish bill. Juveniles are more spotted and may recall other large pipits in wintering areas. Rather distinctive in its wagtail-like stance and foraging behavior. Usually found feeding on the ground in open habitats, sand dunes, dry grasslands, and gravel pits. Call is a harsh ""tschlip""."
220,Spotted Redshank,/species/spored/IN-PB-SH,"Elegant wader with a long fine bill and long reddish legs (dark on breeding adults). Striking breeding plumage dark overall. Nonbreeding plumage is paler and grayer than smaller and chunkier Common Redshank. In flight often appears dark overall with narrow white oval up middle of back. Breeds in arctic bogs and swamps; migrants occur in varied wetland habitats. Usually seen as singles or small groups, though will sometimes congregate in large flocks, especially on wintering grounds. Feeds mainly by wading in fairly deep water, probing and picking with its bill, at times swimming."
221,Long-billed Pipit,/species/lobpip1/IN-PB-SH,"A large, slender pipit with considerable variation across its range. African and South Asian birds average browner, warmer-colored, and more heavily streaked on the breast than the grayer-toned Middle Eastern subspecies. All subspecies possess a pale eyebrow, a long tail, and a relatively long bill. As with many other pipits, can be frustratingly difficult to identify in the field; habitat and voice are important clues. Prefers dry, open areas with clumps of vegetation and scattered rocks and boulders, typically on slopes. Calls include squeaky sparrow-like chirps and sweet two-noted whistles. Song doesn’t quite sound like a song: a sequence of plaintive whistles, two-noted chirps, and other call-like vocalizations strung together with pauses in between."
222,Great Crested Grebe,/species/grcgre1/IN-PB-SH,"Fairly common on lakes, reservoirs, and along larger rivers, mainly with bordering reeds where it builds a floating nest platform. In winter sometimes seen on inshore ocean waters (mainly in freezing weather). Breeding pairs are territorial, but flocks form in winter. Large, elegant, and long-necked grebe. Breeding plumage has beautiful tawny cheeks and black crests (often held flat). In nonbreeding plumage, face and neck bright white with dark line through eye."
223,Greater Spotted Eagle,/species/grseag1/IN-PB-SH,"Adults are large and quite uniform dark brown eagles with very broad wings and short tails. Single white ""comma"" mark at the wrist of the underwing. Similar to the Lesser Spotted Eagle, which is smaller, paler, and more contrasting. Juveniles are more boldly patterned with numerous prominent dirty white spots on the back and upper wings. More tied to forests than Lesser Spotted Eagle, but still near rivers and bogs. Frequents humanmade habitats more often in winter, such as lakes, rubbish dumps, and reservoirs."
224,Oriental Skylark,/species/orisky1/IN-PB-SH,"Chunky brown songbird with a weak crest, typically found on the ground in open fields and meadows. Darker above than below, with fine black streaking on the chest and light chestnut ear coverts with dark border. Very similar to Eurasian Skylark, with which it shares much of its range, but Oriental has buffy, not white, outer tail edges and trailing edge of wing. Breeding males “skylark,” singing a series of variable notes while hovering high above the territory."
225,Steppe Eagle,/species/steeag1/IN-PB-SH,"A large eagle with rich brown plumage, wide wings, and seven well-splayed “fingers” at the wingtip. Adults are entirely dark brown; juveniles and immatures at rest show a distinctive wide white band bordered with black on the wing. In flight, this transforms into a white traverse band on the underwing that forms the base of the primary and secondary feathers. Birds take about four years to attain adult plumage. Frequents open grasslands, deserts, scrub, wetlands, and mountains, and is a regular carcass feeder along with vultures."
226,Himalayan Rubythroat,/species/himrub1/IN-PB-SH,"Shy inhabitant of thickets and dense grassy areas from subalpine scrub to above treeline. Male is gunmetal gray with a white brow, bright orange throat, and a black patch extending from the face down to the breast. Very similar to the closely related Chinese Rubythroat, which has a white moustachial stripe. Chinese Rubythroat female averages browner than female Himalayan, but is best identified by range; Chinese breeds in central and south-central China, while Himalayan breeds along the Himalayas, in Xinjiang, and in Central Asia. Female Himalayan has a weaker eyebrow than female Siberian Rubythroat, and is darker overall."
227,Pied Kingfisher,/species/piekin1/IN-PB-SH,"Boldly marked black-and-white kingfisher with short, bushy crest and glossy all-dark bill. Superficially similar to Crested Kingfisher, but smaller, with a much more distinctly patterned head and breast and less erect crest. Frequently seen perched in pairs or small groups. Often hovers over water when seeking prey. Inhabits a wide range of waterside habitats, from lakes to estuaries to mangroves. Gives a variety of sharp notes, as well as dry trilling and rattling calls."
228,Scaly Thrush,/species/scathr8/IN-PB-SH,"Large thrush with black-edged golden “scaly” feathering. Distinctive in much of range, but a source of consternation in areas overlapping with closely related White’s Thrush; taxonomy and distinguishing characteristics still not completely resolved. Song is a disjointed series of halting ringing notes, often including harsher, buzzier elements; very different from whistles of White’s Thrush. Breeds in hill and montane forests and winters at lower altitudes in forests and forest edge."
229,Rufous-gorgeted Flycatcher,/species/rugfly1/IN-PB-SH,"A bold little flycatcher of mid- to high-altitude forests with a flashing black-and-white tail. Male is brown above with a black face, white eyebrow, and orange throat patch (gorget). The female is essentially a faded version of the male with a dark gray face and a pale, largely unnoticeable gorget. Usually perches at middle levels, sallying from its perch to catch flying insects. Often joins mixed-species feeding flocks."
230,Russet Sparrow,/species/russpa2/IN-PB-SH,"Well-attired small songbird typically associated with mid- to high-elevation farms, fields, and open forests throughout its range. Found in less intensively developed areas than House and Eurasian Tree Sparrows, sticking to villages and pastures and staying away from large city centers. Male has bright chestnut cap and back, whitish cheek, narrow black throat, and pale gray belly. Female brownish with broad streaks above, pale below, with white wingbars and broad tan supercilium."
231,Olive-backed Pipit,/species/olbpip/IN-PB-SH,"Small pipit with a greenish-brown back and heavily streaked breast and belly that is often seen in loose flocks or in pairs. Note the distinctive facial pattern: broad pale lines surrounding the eye and a dark ear patch. Prefers more forested areas than other pipits, though will also forage in fields and scrubby edges. Can be tolerant of human activity and is not uncommon in rural areas and city parks in parts of their range. Calls are high-pitched “tseep’s,” often with a buzzy quality. Song is a beautiful series of warbling trills, whistles, and rattles."
232,Brown Fish-Owl,/species/brfowl1/IN-PB-SH,"Huge bulky brown owl with a finely streaked breast, a plain face, and bright yellow eyes. Also note its dirty white “bib” and the heavy brow that gives it a moody demeanor. Inhabits waterside wooded areas from lowlands up into the mountains; feeds by dropping down into and wading around in creeks, lakes, and pools. Often gives deep echoing hoots, as well as various shrieks and higher-pitched hoots."
233,Blyth's Pipit,/species/blypip1/IN-PB-SH,"A mid-sized pipit with pale brown plumage and a fine, dark bill. Strong streaking on the head, mantle, and back contrasts strongly with the pale edges of the feathers. The face appears clean and the eyebrow appears to start behind the eye. The wings show distinct white bars and there are fine streaks on the breast. Extremely similar to Paddyfield and Richard’s Pipits, but slightly bigger than the former and smaller than the latter, and paler and more contrasting overall than either of them. Inhabits grassy fields. The song is a series of short, raspy notes. The call is a sharp, explosive “shpeeu,” sometimes followed by single-syllabled “chup” notes."
234,Alpine Swift,/species/alpswi1/IN-PB-SH,"Spectacular and distinctive large, dark brown swift with white belly and throat patch. Noticeably larger than Common Swift and Blyth’s Swift, but with slower wingbeats and a ""lazier"" and wider soaring flight. Breeds colonially in cliff faces, mountains, and larger buildings. Migratory in parts of its range. Call is an extremely shrill, chittering scream."
235,Tawny Eagle,/species/taweag1/IN-PB-SH,"A medium-large, highly variable eagle that can range in overall color from whitish or creamy dull rufous to grayish-brown, and rarely dark brown. It has a moderately long gape line that stops at the center of the eye and slit-shaped nostrils. Legs are short and heavily feathered, with baggy “trousers.” Juveniles are generally paler than adults, while older immatures can have a dark hood and pale body. Mostly a bird of plains and open scrub; rarely seen over water, and avoids forests. Overall not as heavy looking as the Steppe Eagle, and never has a rich brown color tone."
236,Black-headed Gull,/species/bkhgul/IN-PB-SH,"Fairly small gull, common and widespread across Eurasia. All plumages have big white blaze on leading edge of wing. Breeding adult has dark brown (not black) hood, red bill and legs; nonbreeding and immature have dark ear spot on white head, dark tip to red bill. Juvenile has mottled brownish back, which molts to pale gray by winter. Can be found in essentially any wet habitat, from duck ponds and farm fields to wild wetlands and seacoasts. Locally occurs in flocks of hundreds, sometimes thousands. Rare but regular vagrant to North America, especially in the northeast, where usually seen singly among flocks of Bonaparte’s or Ring-billed Gulls. Compared to nonbreeding Bonaparte’s, note Black-headed’s red bill, dark red legs, and more extensive black in underwings."
237,Small Pratincole,/species/smapra1/IN-PB-SH,"Small bird that resembles a combination of a dove, a swallow, and a plover. Soft gray-brown with a tan wash on the throat and black lores. Black-and-white wing pattern prominent in flight. Flight agile and erratic, resembling a bat or swallow; frequently flies in flocks at dusk. Favors rocky or sandy islands in rivers, but can also be found in marshes, estuaries, and lakesides. Distinguished from other pratincoles in range by smaller size and gray plumage. Calls are a high rolling “chirrit!”, reminiscent of terns."
238,Rosy Pipit,/species/rospip1/IN-PB-SH,"An elegant, well-marked pipit that breeds in montane regions,but descends down into meadows and agricultural fields in the winter. Breeding adult is unmistakable with a soft pink throat and breast. Nonbreeding adults and immature birds lack the pink breast, but have a thick creamy white brow and mustache stripe, as well as thick blotchy streaking on the breast. Buff-bellied and Red-throated Pipits are also strongly marked on the breast, but both have much weaker brow patterns than Rosy Pipit. Gives a squeaky “tseep!”. Sings repetitive high-pitched song from the ground and while in the air."
239,Eurasian Hobby,/species/eurhob/IN-PB-SH,"Streamlined long-winged falcon. Note gray upperparts with plain tail, boldly streaked underparts with rusty leggings and vent. Swift-like; flight more graceful and aerodynamic than Eurasian Kestrel. Compare with larger, stockier, shorter-tailed Peregrine Falcon. Favors open woodland, heathland, and farmland with stands of trees; often hunts over nearby water bodies and marshes. Hunts in the air, catching dragonflies, swallows, and other birds, which it sometimes eats on the wing."
240,Hair-crested Drongo,/species/hacdro1/IN-PB-SH,"A large and stocky black drongo with glimmering blue iridescence on the wings, breast, and neck. Note triangular tail with flaring tips that curl out sideways and a large, curved bill with which it crushes insects and probes for nectar. Long, thin, hair-like feathers on its forehead, present only in some subspecies, may be visible at close range. Birds in Java and Sulawesi have white eyes. Encountered singly or in small flocks; also joins foraging flocks with other species. Found in a wide range of forested habitats, where it often uses exposed perches. Calls include a varied jumble of various harsh screeches, nasal yelps, metallic sounds, and beeps."
241,Water Pipit,/species/watpip1/IN-PB-SH,"Breeding plumage grayish above with white eyebrow; breast pale pinkish, mostly unstreaked. Nonbreeding plumage grayish brown above, whitish below with dark streaks; averages smudgier and less well-marked than American Pipit. Sides of tail clean white; compare with dingy white of Rock Pipit in areas of overlap. Song is a long series of repeated high-pitched notes; essentially a slow trill. Call a high, lisping, slightly upslurred ""ssiip.” Breeds in mountains on barren, often rocky ground; winters in varied wetland habitats, from lakeshores to salt marshes."
242,Long-legged Buzzard,/species/lolbuz1/IN-PB-SH,"A large, long-winged buzzard which may recall a small eagle in size. Variable plumage with three color morphs. All have obvious dark carpal patches at the wrist of the wing. Juveniles lack the adult’s prominent black trailing edge to the wings. Often hunts from a prominent perch, or sits on the ground and scans for prey. A species of open steppe and desert country, sometimes in more wooded areas but always near big open spaces. Compare with similar Common and Upland Buzzards, as well as Rough-legged Hawk; note long-winged structure, size, and wings held in “V” in soaring flight."
243,Black Bittern,/species/blabit1/IN-PB-SH,"Medium-sized heron of forested and vegetated wetlands, ponds, and lakes. All ages and plumages have dark upperparts and orange, yellow, and reddish striping on the neck and breast. Female and immature average browner with weaker contrast than males. Typically hides and hunts in vegetation similar to other bitterns but occasionally perches visibly on trees and bushes."
244,Red-headed Bunting,/species/rehbun1/IN-PB-SH,"Large, stocky bunting with a long tail. Rusty-red head and yellow body easily identify the breeding male; non-breeding male has restricted red on the head and a streaky brown back. Female and juvenile are pale brown with streaked back and wings; these plumages can be nearly impossible to separate from Black-headed Bunting. Look out for Red-headed’s less extensive crown streaking, less “compact” appearance (longer-billed and longer-tailed), less yellow underparts, and colder back coloration. Breeds in open dry spaces with scattered bushes; winters in agricultural fields. Song starts out with a few dry, rasping notes, then turns into a more fluid-sounding jumble."
245,Clamorous Reed Warbler,/species/clrwar1/IN-PB-SH,"Large brown reed warbler with a long, powerful-looking bill. Birds in the Middle East and northeastern Africa average warmer brown than in southern Asia. Most readily confused with other large reed warblers. Oriental Reed Warbler has a “rough-looking,” vaguely streaked throat unlike the clean throat of the Clamorous Reed Warbler. Worn birds may not be identifiable to species level, especially if seen poorly. Great Reed Warbler is similar, but has pink instead of gray legs. Breeds in a wide range of wetland habitats, including freshwater marshes, lakeshores, and mangroves; even in cultivation in some areas. Non-breeding habitats also include drier areas. Song is a loud and jumbled series of harsh grating sounds. Calls include loud, forceful, and hard-sounding chuck’s and churrs."
246,Bronze-winged Jacana,/species/brwjac1/IN-PB-SH,"Gangly inhabitant of well-vegetated wetlands, especially ponds and lakes with floating vegetation. Adult’s dark neck and bright white eyebrows are unmistakable. Juvenile’s white cheek and orangish neck can lead to confusion with Pheasant-tailed Jacana; look for Bronze-winged’s wholly brown wings."
247,Great White Pelican,/species/grwpel1/IN-PB-SH,"A large white waterbird with a hefty bill and a yellow-orange throat pouch. Note the pink bare skin around eye that extends towards the bill. Young birds have browner overall plumage relative to adults with brown upper wings and a brown head. Legs are pink. In flight shows dark flight feathers which contrast with the rest of the wing. Often seen fishing cooperatively, swimming in a wide arc to round up the fish and then scoop them into their pouch."
248,Indian Bushlark,/species/indbus2/IN-PB-SH,"A relatively lean-looking, pale brown bushlark with streaking on the upperparts and spots on the breast. The white eyebrow goes all the way around the ears and encloses the cheeks. Similar to other bushlarks, but it appears more slender and has a longer tail, longer legs, and a smaller bill. Some birds show a distinctive reddish tinge to the wings. It inhabits dry, open areas with rocks, scrub, and grassland. Calls include a pleasant mix of rising and descending whistles and series of trills."
249,Cinnamon Bittern,/species/cinbit1/IN-PB-SH,"Small heron of wet and open grassy areas such as flooded meadows and paddy fields. Uniformly bright rufous upperparts of adult male unmistakable. Female and juvenile have pale streaked belly, dark streaks and spots scattered on the wings and back, and are dark brown with some rufous tones above. Females often have light spotting on the wings, potentially causing confusion with female Schrenck's Bittern, which has brighter and more solid white spots and a prominent dark crown lacking in Cinnamon. Gives dry croaking clicks."
250,Booted Warbler,/species/boowar1/IN-PB-SH,"Small, recalling a beige chiffchaff or other Phylloscopus warbler. Rather nondescript: gray brown above, paler below, with a short, dark-tipped bill and conspicuous pale eyebrow. Pot-bellied with short wings and a square-tipped tail. Can be extremely difficult to identify; compare carefully with small Acrocephalus warblers and other Iduna warblers, especially Sykes’s Warbler. Found in low bushes in steppes and meadows; also bushy areas in migration and in winter. Usually forages low down, and occasionally on the ground. Song starts out with a few dry chitters, then launches into a rapidfire burst of high-pitched chattering that almost stumbles over itself. Also gives dry “tchak” and rattle calls."
251,Eurasian Spoonbill,/species/eurspo1/IN-PB-SH,"Distinctive, large white wading bird with a spatula for a bill. Adult has short crest, yellowish breast patch. First year has paler bill, with fine black wingtips visible in flight. Sleeping birds have horizontal posture and bulging neck, vs. more vertical stance of egrets. Found in wetlands with shallow water (including tidal flats), where feeds by sweeping its bill side-to-side for crustaceans and small fish. May be confused with egrets when sleeping, but note stockier, more thickset overall appearance."
252,Gray-bellied Cuckoo,/species/placuc3/IN-PB-SH,"Rather small cuckoo of open forests and forest edge. Typical adult is gray all over. Some females are “hepatic” and are ginger-orangish with black barring on the back and on the undersides. Song is a high, fading “ki-keeeer...” often given either very early or very late in the day. Breeds in foothill and montane forests, but migratory individuals typically winter in lowlands."
253,White-eyed Buzzard,/species/whebuz1/IN-PB-SH,"A slim brown buzzard with a distinct white iris. Adults have a white throat with a prominent dark stripe, yellow base of the bill, and rufous tail. Dark tips to wing feathers are clearly visible in flight. Often shows a white patch on its nape. Juveniles have a buffy head and brown iris. The usual habitat is dry, open country or forest, where it mainly feed on insects, rodents, and small mammals. This species is most often seen soaring alone in thermals or perched still. Groups of two or three may sometimes be seen. The most commonly heard call is a plaintive mewing note or falling whistle."
254,Western House-Martin,/species/comhom1/IN-PB-SH,"Distinctive small swallow with blue-black upperparts, a big white rump patch, and snow-white underparts. Juvenile in late summer and autumn is duller above and dingier below than adult. Compare with other swallows; note the relatively shallowly forked and streamerless tail, as well as jerky and fluttery flight. In east of range, overlaps with very similar Siberian House-Martin (formerly treated as one species); note present species’ significantly smaller rump patch. Breeds colonially, frequently building mud nests under the eaves of buildings; forages over varied open and semi-open habitats, especially water bodies and adjacent fields. Gives a soft burbling trill."
255,Square-tailed Drongo-Cuckoo,/species/asidrc3/IN-PB-SH,"A small, slim black cuckoo rather similar to Black Drongo but smaller, with a curved bill. Adult black with white bars in the undertail, shorter-tailed juvenile deep blackish gray with bright white dots in wings and flanks. Rather sedentary and difficult to see in tangled vegetation of scrubby and edge habitats in lowland and foothill forests. Song a loud, vibrant, rapid series of ascending hoarse whistles."
256,Black-tailed Godwit,/species/bktgod/IN-PB-SH,"Gregarious medium-sized wader with a long, slightly uptilted bill. Note the very long, pink-based bill. Breeding plumage has bright rusty head and breast, dark barring on belly; nonbreeding plumage has rather plain grayish head, breast, and upperparts, unlike streaked breast and back of Bar-tailed Godwit. In flight shows bold white wing stripe, white rump, and black tail. Fairly common but often local; breeds in grassy wetlands, and found year-round in fresh and brackish marshes, and on adjacent tidal flats. Feeds mainly by wading in deep water, probing with its long bill."
257,Whiskered Tern,/species/whiter2/IN-PB-SH,"Small buoyant tern. Breeding adult has distinctive dark smoky gray body and contrasting white cheeks (can look like broad white ""whiskers"" in flight) underneath a black cap. Nonbreeding plumage pale silvery gray overall with a faded shadow of the cap; juvenile has dark-checkered back. Note rather stout bill (albeit thinner than Gull-billed Tern) and square tail; compare to Common, Roseate, and Arctic Terns. Feeds by picking from surface, not splash-diving like typical terns. Common around wetlands, lakes, and rivers."
258,Striated Grassbird,/species/strgra1/IN-PB-SH,"Streaky brown bird of fields, scrubby edge, and dense thickets. This large but retiring warbler is most often seen as a flash of chestnut rump and long, trailing tail as it flushes from close proximity. Occasionally perches out into the open, sometimes even on telephone lines. Warm brown with black streaking all over; size, shape, and habitat distinguish this species from similarly-colored cisticolas, prinias, and babblers. Song usually starts off with a few sharp introductory notes, then descends into jumbled, rich warbling. Gives “piht” calls, often repetitively."
259,River Lapwing,/species/rivlap1/IN-PB-SH,"The black, gray, and brown coloration of this medium-sized shorebird makes it unmistakable. Raises black crest when displaying. As the name suggests, this species is primarily tied to rivers, where it is often seen foraging in pairs on riverbanks or exposed islands. Calls shrilly and loudly, both during display and when alarmed."
260,Short-eared Owl,/species/sheowl/IN-PB-SH,"Medium-sized owl, more frequently seen in the daytime than other owls. Especially active around dawn and dusk, when it flies lazily over open fields or marshes in search of small mammals. Varies across a wide range, with Galapagos birds being the darkest. Brown overall, palest on belly, with streaks and spots on wings and chest. Large pale patch near the wingtips easily visible in flight. Rarely heard vocalizing away from breeding grounds, where it makes a low series of hoots and a variety of harsh barking noises."
261,Chestnut-eared Bunting,/species/chebun2/IN-PB-SH,"Burly brown bunting; gets more attractive as you look at it more closely. Brown overall, but intricately patterned in various shades of gray, brown, and black. Combination of a grayish head, extensive dark streaking on the upperparts, and a large brown patch behind the ear (only chestnut in adult males) is unique in the region. Typically inhabits reed beds, grassy fields, and scrubby farmland where it often appears in scattered flocks. Song, usually given from an elevated, exposed perch, is a jumble of twittering, clattering notes. Calls include high, thin “tsik” and lower “chuck.”"
262,Isabelline Wheatear,/species/isawhe1/IN-PB-SH,"A large pale wheatear. Gray-brown above with warm orangish tones on white underparts and a pale white eyebrow. Tail is predominantly black with white edges and it contrasts sharply with its snow-white rump. Somewhat similar in coloration to a toned-down female Northern Wheatear, but visibly larger, shorter-tailed, and longer-billed (all of which are accentuated by the typically tall, erect posture). Inhabits flat, open areas, often at middle to high elevations. Remarkable song has a tumbling quality that includes long ringing whistles, chattering, and imitations of other sounds in the surrounding environment. Calls include shorter whistles and hard “chak’s,” like rocks being struck together."
263,Gray Bushchat,/species/grybus1/IN-PB-SH,"Small songbird of forest edges, open scrub, and farmland, usually seen in pairs or small flocks. Male is silvery gray overall with black face and white supercilium, throat, belly, and wing patches. Female dull brown overall, with a rufous tail and faded version of the male's head pattern. Bold but not very active, usually seen perching for long periods on posts and overhead wires. Song is bright and melodious, but often has a somewhat faltering quality, trailing off towards the end. Most common call is a harsh rising “bzeeet!”."
264,Whistler's Warbler,/species/whiwar2/IN-PB-SH,"One of a confusingly similar complex of species, this medium-sized warbler has a bright yellow eye-ring, a pale and indistinct wingbar, and a grayish crown bordered by two long black stripes. The weakness and greenish cast of the gray crown separates this species from various other “golden-spectacled”-type warblers, such as Gray-crowned. Golden-spectacled Warbler is very similar; in Whistler’s, look out for an unbroken eye-ring, a shorter bill, a longer tail, and slightly duller green upperparts. Whistler’s breeds in high-altitude temperate broadleaf forest from around 2000 meters up to the treeline; averages higher in altitudinal breeding preferences than Golden-spectacled Warbler. Like other “golden-spectacled”-type warblers, Whistler’s typically forages at lower and middle levels of forest, often mixing with other species and making flycatching sallies. Song consists of a 2- or 3-noted whistled phrase repeated 2-3 times without pause, lacking the trills of Golden-spectacled Warbler."
265,Blue-bearded Bee-eater,/species/bbbeat1/IN-PB-SH,"A large bee-eater which appears greenish overall. Note the bluish-green forehead, the long blue streak down the throat to the breast, and the dull yellow belly with green streaks. It has a dark, heavy bill and a long tail. Its flight is undulating, short, and rapid. Unlike other bee-eaters, it does not soar often, nor does it appear graceful in flight. It can be inconspicuous as it sticks to the mid-canopy of the wooded groves and forests it inhabits. Calls include deep throaty clucks, low growls, and dry croaks."
266,Crimson Sunbird,/species/eacsun1/IN-PB-SH,"A common sight throughout much of its range, this medium-sized sunbird can be found in parks, gardens, and plantations, as well as more pristine open forest and forest edge environments. Male is bright red with a dark gray belly and iridescent blue cap and “moustache.” Female is dull olive-yellow overall with brighter underparts. High, squeaky repetitive song is loud but often difficult to locate in high branches. Calls frequently, giving various squeaks and “tsip” notes while foraging."
267,Black Bulbul,/species/blabul1/IN-PB-SH,"Medium-sized songbird with predominantly dark plumage, a very short crest, and crimson bill and legs. Long tail and bill impart an elongated appearance. Head color varies considerably across distribution, ranging from white to dark gray to black. Often travels in large flocks, which move noisily between fruiting trees. Most commonly found in broadleaf evergreen and mixed deciduous forests but also regularly visits gardens and lowland forests. Extremely noisy, with a huge repertoire, emitting various squeaks, meows, chatters, whistles, and more."
268,Blue Whistling-Thrush,/species/blwthr1/IN-PB-SH,"Large, found along streams in forested hills and mountains. Dark purple with tiny silvery spots on head, back, and wings. Bill color varies with range: dark in central and eastern China and parts of mainland Southeast Asia, bright yellow in populations elsewhere. Frequently fans tail while standing on an exposed perch such as a waterside rock or overhanging branch. True to its name, it does whistle: a long piercing note that carries well over the sound of rushing water."
269,Black-throated Accentor,/species/bltacc1/IN-PB-SH,"An uncommon, sharply-marked accentor with broad pale stripes on its black head. Generally, prefers less open habitats than other accentors; usually found in low bushes and scrubs instead of exposed meadows and plains. Individuals with buffier head markings can look similar to Siberian Accentor, but Black-throated sport the namesake dark throat, instead of a Siberian’s pale throat."
270,Siberian Rubythroat,/species/sibrub/IN-PB-SH,"Perky, long-legged songbird that winters in areas with dense understory coverage, often near wet areas; breeds in open taiga and highland forest clearings. Shy, tends to stay hidden. Pale brown above, whitish below, with olive-brown flanks and pale supercilium. Adult male has the namesake jewel-like red throat, bordered in black and white; younger male may have a hint of red, while female lacks red. Often droops wings and cocks tail upright. Variable melodic song consists of beautiful warbling and occasional mimicry; calls include low, hoarse “chuk” and high “chelee.”"
271,Bar-tailed Treecreeper,/species/battre1/IN-PB-SH,"Typical treecreeper, brown above and white below with a short decurved bill and a long stiff tail. White is brightest on the throat and fades into gray on the lower breast and belly. Fine dark barring on the tail distinguishes this species from otherwise identical relatives in its range. Inhabits high-altitude coniferous and mixed forests, where it can often be found trailing along with mixed-species flocks."
272,Black-throated Thrush,/species/datthr1/IN-PB-SH,"A dark, somberly-colored thrush of middle to high-altitude forests. Usually winters at higher elevations, but will occasionally move into foothill and lowland areas as well. Male is unmistakable, with a gray back, white belly, and a pitch-black throat and chest. Females are streaky brown below and may be confused with Red-throated Thrush, but Black-throated females do not show orange on the throat or the sides of the tail; the only warm colors on either bird are the orangish underwings. In areas of overlap, beware hybrids that may show features of both species. Song consists of various repeated phrases; call includes a low “chekchekchek” and high, thin “tseee.”"
273,Orange-headed Thrush,/species/orhthr1/IN-PB-SH,"Brightly-colored ground-dwelling thrush. Bright orange head, breast, and belly are unmistakable. Some subspecies have two broad black crescents on the sides of the face. Hops about foraging in the leaf litter in forested areas, often in wet gullies and ravines. Beautiful song is composed of well-spaced strophes of warbling and buzzy notes."
274,Isabelline Shrike,/species/isashr1/IN-PB-SH,"Small pale sandy-colored shrike. Male is gray-brown above with a black mask and unmarked pale underparts that contrast with a bright cinnamon tail. Female is similar, but with a paler mask, grayer upperparts, and faint barring on the sides. Both sexes have pale underparts. Red-tailed Shrike looks similar, but male Red-tailed Shrikes have a contrasting warm brownish crown and females average whiter on the underparts. Female Red-backed Shrikes also have a warmer brown back and more prominent scaling patterns on a white breast and belly than Isabelline Shrikes. Typically found in dry brushy areas. Song composed of various whistles, warbles, and mimicry; calls are harsh and sometimes nasal."
275,Slaty-headed Parakeet,/species/slhpar1/IN-PB-SH,"A medium-sized parakeet with a bluish-gray head, green body, red bill, and yellow-tipped tail. Males and females are alike, except that males have a red patch on the shoulder. Often found in large flocks which feed on fruits, blossoms, and crops. The call is a harsh, grating screech with a metallic quality. Similar to Gray-headed Parakeet, but Slaty-headed Parakeet has a darker head, an indistinct black collar, and a different call."
276,Great Barbet,/species/grebar1/IN-PB-SH,"This largest of the barbets is colorful, but often appears all-dark from a distance. No other barbet in its range combines the features of a massive pale bill, black head, and dark olive back. Sluggish and shy; tends to stick to dense forest canopy, where it is difficult to see. Its loud hooting song (typically a series of two repetitive notes) is often the only indication of this species’s presence. Also gives a harsh, screaming “karrrrr” that has a gull-like quality."
277,Tickell's Leaf Warbler,/species/y00989/IN-PB-SH,"Brown-and-yellow leaf warbler without a wingbar. Breeds in high-altitude areas, in open areas with low vegetation. Winters at lower elevations, including throughout the Indian Subcontinent south of the Himalayas, where it is most abundant in shrubbery in the northeast Indian plains and in the high Western Ghats. Resembles Sulphur-bellied Warbler, but has a yellower cheek and underparts, and shows little contrast between the eyebrow and the throat. Tickell’s spends less time on or near the ground than Sulphur-bellied, tends to flock, and often participates in mixed-species foraging flocks."
278,Cinereous Vulture,/species/cinvul1/IN-PB-SH,"Huge, majestic, dark-brown vulture. In flight, looks all dark, with some contrast between the leading edge and trailing edge from below. Soars on flat wings, often slightly drooping, with prominent wing fingers and a saw-toothed trailing edge. Juvenile lacks the adult’s pale head patches. Imposing and dominant over other vultures at carcasses. Forages over rugged mountains, upland forests, grasslands, and steppes. Sometimes disperses significant distances in the winter."
279,Himalayan Griffon,/species/himgri1/IN-PB-SH,"A regal raptor of steppes, valleys, and mountainous regions, this large scavenger is fairly common throughout most of its range. Adult is sandy brown with a pale, featherless head. When in flight, the bird has black primaries and a small-headed, squared-winged appearance. Usually seen singly or in small groups; gathers in large flocks at a carcass. The principal scavenger at Tibetan sky burials."
280,Cotton Pygmy-Goose,/species/copgoo1/IN-PB-SH,"Tiny duck. Male has a bright white head and neck with a dark crown and eyes. Female is plainer, with a strong dark eye-line that does not continue back to the nape. In flight, females have thin white edges on the trailing edge of the wings, while males have big white slashes on the wings. Usually seen swimming in freshwater wetlands, including small ponds and farm dams, especially those with extensive floating vegetation."
281,Lemon-rumped Warbler,/species/parwar1/IN-PB-SH,"Small leaf warbler with many extremely similar relatives. Like other “Pallas’s-type” leaf warblers, has olive-yellow upperparts, pale underparts, prominent brow and crown stripes, double wingbars, and a pale rump. Unlike Ashy-throated and Buff-barred Warblers, lacks any white on outer tail edges. Pallas’s averages yellower-headed and brighter overall. Gansu and Chinese Leaf Warblers can be incredibly similar, but Lemon-rumped averages whiter-browed and yellower-bellied than the former, more contrastingly-marked on the head than the latter, and darker-billed than both. As with many other physically similar leaf warblers, best distinguished by voice and habitat. Breeds in coniferous and mixed forests at mid- to high-elevation forests, though may descend into foothills in the winter. Two song types are both highly distinctive; one is a buzzy, descending rattling trill and the other is a series of high-pitched clicking twitters. Call is a loud, strident pair of notes: “pse-tew!”"
282,Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker,/species/fubwoo2/IN-PB-SH,"Medium-sized woodpecker with stained yellowish-brown underparts. Note white barring on back and thin stripes down the neck and chest. Male has an all-red crown, female an all-black one. Compare with Stripe-breasted Woodpecker, which is whiter-faced and has more extensive and better-defined stripes on the underparts. Gives a sharp “tik” as well as a rolling rattle. Prefers open forest and forest edge."
283,Sarus Crane,/species/sarcra1/IN-PB-SH,"Tall pale gray crane with pink legs and red bare skin on head extending down the neck. Juvenile facial coloring less prominent. Typically wades in shallow wetlands or in cropped agricultural areas. Unmistakable in Asia. In Australia, take care to identify from Brolga, which has black legs and gray upper neck. Listen for its loud, far-carrying bugling calls."
284,Pallas's Gull,/species/gbhgul2/IN-PB-SH,"Large powerful gull of saline, brackish, and fresh water bodies. Breeding adult has a black head with a thin incomplete crescent around the eye and a red-and-black-tipped bill. Nonbreeding adults retain a partial “hood” of patchy black on the back of the head. Young birds also have this dark patch, though it is much smaller in size. The eye crescents and a flashing white rump help to distinguish first-winter birds from Herring-type gulls. Can be readily separated by size in any plumage from the smaller dark-headed gulls."
285,Blue-cheeked Bee-eater,/species/bcbeat1/IN-PB-SH,"A lime-green bee-eater with a thin black mask edged with aquamarine blue. Bright yellow-and-red throat patch is small compared to many other bee-eaters. Somewhat similar to Blue-tailed Bee-eater; look out for less extensive blue around the eye on Blue-tailed, the namesake blue tail, and a larger orange throat patch compared to Blue-cheeked Bee-eater. Found in open areas as well as forests from lowlands up into middle elevations. Gives a pleasantly mellow call starting off with a ticking note, followed by a trill."
286,Common Cuckoo,/species/comcuc/IN-PB-SH,"Found in woodland, heathland, farmland with hedges, marshes with scattered bushes. ""COO-koo"" song (like a cuckoo clock) often given from open perch. Note long wings and tail, barred belly, rather small bill. Flight direct and often low, suggesting a hawk or falcon. Extremely similar in appearance to various other Cuculus cuckoos across its range; note the combination of white vent, staring yellow irises, and overall large size. Lays eggs in nests of other birds, particularly pipits and reed warblers, which raise the young cuckoos."
287,Blue Rock-Thrush,/species/burthr/IN-PB-SH,"Medium-sized thrush-like bird, often seen on mountainsides, sea cliffs, quarries, ruins, and even towns. Males usually unmistakable: western birds are dark blue all over, but may appear all dark at a distance; eastern birds are blue with orange underparts. Females dark brown above, finely barred below. Long bill, wings, and tail make for a distinctive and very different shape than Rufous-tailed Rock-Thrush. Song is melodic and blackbird-like."
288,Paddyfield Warbler,/species/padwar1/IN-PB-SH,"Warm brown above and pale below; strong dark eyestripe contrasts with white eyebrow. Smallish reed warbler with long and strongly rounded tail, short bill with dark tip, and short primary projection. Difficult to separate visually from other small Acrocephalus warblers, especially Blunt-winged Warbler; note Paddyfield’s more prominent pale eyebrow which strengthens behind the eye, as well as longer-winged appearance. Also compare with Iduna warblers. Breeds in extensive reed beds; in nonbreeding season found in marshes, but also more scrubby areas. Distinctive, melodious song."
289,Greater Whitethroat,/species/grewhi1/IN-PB-SH,"Found in open, scrubby habitats from coastal heaths, open woodlands, and low hedges to bramble thickets on waste ground. Rather retiring, like most warblers, but jerky climbing display flight often draws attention. Also gives its burbling, buzzing song from a perch. Often gives a rising, sparrow-like “weet, weet.” Plumage brownish overall with bright rusty wings; grayer head has narrow whitish eyering and sets off white throat, which often looks a little puffy."
290,Little Stint,/species/litsti/IN-PB-SH,"Tiny shorebird with extensive range across Europe, Africa, and Asia. Very rare vagrant in North America. All ages show dark legs and a straight, fine-tipped bill. Adults in breeding plumage are variably flushed with bright rusty orange on the head, neck sides, and upperparts, usually brightest in mid- to late-summer. Compared with breeding Red-necked Stint, note white throat and more uniformly bright wing coverts and scapulars on Little. Juveniles are typically quite bright and neatly patterned above, often with bold white stripes or ""braces"" down the back, and have very black-centered wing coverts and tertials. Nonbreeding birds rather plain pale gray and extremely difficult to separate from other small “peeps”. Note bill shape and overall structure. Temminck’s has longer tail and more crouched posture; Red-necked has slightly shorter bill and legs and more attenuated wings. Found in fresh and brackish wetland habitats. Occurs locally in flocks; elsewhere singles travel with flocks of other waders."
291,Oriental Pratincole,/species/oripra/IN-PB-SH,"Twisting and turning on long, angular wings, this relative of the sandpipers and plovers gives a swallowlike impression in flight. Adults are brown overall with an elegant black necklace and pale yellow throat. When in flight, note dark flight feathers, chestnut underwing coverts, bright white trailing edge to the wings, and a flashing white rump. Juveniles are a mottled gray-brown above and lack the adult's necklace. Flight call a harsh “tarrack.”"
292,Jungle Prinia,/species/junpri1/IN-PB-SH,"Dull brown prinia. Largely devoid of eye-catching field marks: gray-brown above and white below with pale eyebrow. Plain Prinia can be very similar, but Jungle averages larger and more thickset, with a heavier bill and weaker eyebrows. Look for this skulker in dry scrubby tangles, often in areas intermixed with boulders. Forages close to the ground. Song is a rollicking, repetitive “ti’li’lew-ti’li’lew-ti’le’lew.” Also gives various chip notes, as well as a loud chatter when agitated."
293,Sand Lark,/species/sanlar1/IN-PB-SH,"Very pale gray-brown lark with a weak crest. Dark eyes stand out in pale face. Lightly streaked above and clean white below. Highly specialized; found only in dry, sandy waterside areas such as riverbanks, river islands, lakeshores, and coastal areas. Buzzy trilling song usually given in towering flight."
294,Tibetan Sand-Plover,/species/lessap1/IN-PB-SH,"Medium-sized plover with a pale throat, brown back, and white belly. Breeding adults have a black mask and a bright orange chest and neck; males average brighter than females. Non-breeding and immature birds are brownish above and white below, with a variable white forehead and eyebrow. Compare with slightly larger Greater Sand-Plover; Tibetan is proportionally smaller-headed and darker-legged, and its shorter bill has a slight bulge at the tip. Smaller Kentish Plover can be similar in non-breeding plumage; Tibetan is taller and longer-legged, without Kentish’s strong white neck band. Very difficult to distinguish from Siberian Sand-Plover, especially nonbreeding and immature birds, though identification can often be presumed by range. In breeding plumage, note the more extensive black mask of Tibetan, typically lacking the white spot on the forehead of Siberian. In nonbreeding plumage, look for a generally broken breast band and clean white flanks in Tibetan. In areas of overlap many birds best left unidentified. Breeds on margins of high-elevation lakes and rivers in China and Mongolia; winters on coastal mudflats, beaches, and inland lakes from Africa to Indonesia."
295,Greater Sand-Plover,/species/grsplo/IN-PB-SH,"Medium-sized plover with a long hefty bill. Breeding adults have a dark mask and orangish chest, neck, and forehead; females duller than males. Non-breeding birds and immatures are sandy brown above and white below, with a white throat and “eyebrows.” Often confused with Lesser Sand-Plover, and best distinguished when both present; look for larger size, heavier and longer bill, paler legs, and larger-headed appearance. Additionally, unlike some Lesser Sand-Plovers, Greater never has a black boundary around the throat. Breeds in high-elevation areas, where it favors arid, open habitats, sometimes near water. Winters on coastal mudflats and estuaries."
296,Kentish Plover,/species/kenplo1/IN-PB-SH,"Small, pale plover with broken black collar, sandy upperparts, grayish legs, and rather fine black bill. Breeding plumage has black mask and black tabs at sides of breast (not a complete band). Nonbreeding plumages have black replaced by brown. Mainly coastal, on sandy beaches, dry mudflats, and at salt ponds, usually near water; also locally inland. Migrants will join with flocks of other shorebirds."
297,Little Tern,/species/litter1/IN-PB-SH,"Tiny, delicate-looking tern. Mainly coastal, but also occurs inland locally. Breeding plumage has black cap with white forehead chevron, black-tipped yellow bill. Readily identified by tiny size, though wintering adults can be confusingly similar in patterning to Common Tern; look out for black stripes extending from the shoulder to the wingtip. Breeds colonially on sandy and stony substrates, at times with other terns, from beaches to riverbanks and lakeshores. Often overlooked unless noisy and mobbing you at a colony. Flies with hurried deep wingbeats; splash dives in water to catch small fish."
298,Black-winged Cuckooshrike,/species/bkwcus1/IN-PB-SH,"An overall sooty-colored cuckooshrike with broad white tips to the tail feathers. Male is dark sooty-gray with a slaty sheen, slightly paler on rump. Underparts paler toward tail; wings black. Female is very similar to male, but paler in general, often weakly barred with dark and pale gray on underparts. Male has a black mask, while female has dark lores and a faint eyering. Juvenile is blackish-brown above and brownish-gray below, heavily scaled whitish all over, with broad white tips on wing feathers. Immature like female, but more strongly and extensively barred below. Song is a loud series of whistles “pe-pe-pe-peew-peew-pew”; sometimes the starting notes are skipped. Found in all types of woodlands, including broad-leaved forests, sometimes even near cultivation during non-breeding season."
299,Indian Spotted Eagle,/species/inseag1/IN-PB-SH,"A small eagle, slightly larger than a kite but structurally similar to other large eagles, with six splayed “fingers” at the wingtip and a pale rump. Adult is rich brown overall with a long gape line that extends behind the eye. Nostrils are round. Subadults are paler, with light speckles on breast and belly. In flight from below, wings and tail are finely barred with brown on creamy white feathers. Unlike other large eagles, its long legs are lightly feathered, lacking the baggy “trousers.” Soars over grasslands, scrub, light forests, and wetlands; can be found away from wetlands, unlike the Greater Spotted Eagle."
300,Black-headed Bunting,/species/blhbun1/IN-PB-SH,"Large, stocky bunting. On breeding males, the combination of a black head, a bright yellow collar, yellow underparts, and rusty-brown back is unmistakable. The black on the face of nonbreeding males is restricted to the patch around the eyes forming a “bandit’s mask.” Female is plain brown overall with a pale yellowish wash on the vent and traces of yellow on the rump. Extremely similar to female Red-headed Bunting; best to use a combination of various details to separate the two, with the Red-headed Bunting having a yellower rump and belly, a more noticeably streaked crown, and a bulkier bill than Black-headed Bunting. Breeds in open forests, edges, and patchily planted areas like orchards and gardens. Winters in farmland. Song is a rather lacklustre series of buzzy notes. Calls are varied and include sparrowlike chirps and high thin “tseep’s.”"
301,Kalij Pheasant,/species/kalphe/IN-PB-SH,"A distinctive pheasant with bare red facial skin, a backward-pointing crest, and a vertically compressed tail. Males are iridescent black and silver. Females are grayish-brown. Coloration varies considerably throughout its range, with northeastern birds averaging the darkest. Occurs in forested areas, usually in hilly or mountainous regions. Overlaps with Silver Pheasant in the north of its range, with which it produces confusing intergrades. Native to South and Southeast Asia and introduced to the Hawaiian Islands of Hawaii and western Oahu. Males give a soft crow, other calls include low grunts and high-pitched squeals."
302,Western Crowned Warbler,/species/weclew1/IN-PB-SH,"Distinctive leaf warbler with two wingbars, green upperparts often contrasting with the gray head and the striking white underparts, a distinct crown stripe, and a long pale bill. Endemic to the Indian Subcontinent. Breeds in the western and central Himalayas. Winters primarily in southern India. Only leaf warbler other than Tickell’s Leaf Warbler to regularly participate in mixed-species foraging flocks in southern India. Similar to Blyth’s Leaf Warbler, but is less yellow and can be distinguished by its paler crown, more elongated appearance, and song."
303,Ultramarine Flycatcher,/species/ultfly1/IN-PB-SH,"Incandescently beautiful male is resplendent in electric blue and snowy white. Female is dull gray-brown with paler underparts. Slight regional variation: “Western” males have a short white eyebrow and “Eastern” females have a faint rusty patch on the forehead. Male may be confused with Himalayan Bluetail, but lacks orange. Female is similar to females of Slaty-blue and Little Pied Flycatchers, but lacks any rufous tones on the tail. Breeds in hill and montane broadleaf and pine forests; descends into lower foothills in winter. Rarely heard song a complex series of whistles and chatters; more commonly heard is the call, a dry trilling chatter, sometimes preceded by a short whistle."
304,Hume's Lark,/species/humlar1/IN-PB-SH,"Small, pale brown lark. Sandy-colored above and whitish below, with distinct white eyebrows and a slender bill. Greater Short-toed Lark is extremely similar, and distinguished only with difficulty; in Hume’s, look out for a plainer and relatively unstreaked crown, more contrastingly white eyebrows, and a more slender bill. The same combination of characteristics, along with a plain unmarked chest, can also be used to eliminate Asian Short-toed Lark. Clean underparts, lack of a strong crest, and size serve to distinguish Hume’s from other larks. Breeds in high-altitude steppe and plateau regions, in dry areas with sparse vegetation; winters in similar habitat at lower elevations. Song flight is composed of jumbled whistled, warbled, and harsher buzzing notes with long pauses between phrases; includes more whistling than similar-sounding Greater Short-toed Lark, and averages shorter-phrased in full song flight and slower overall. Call is a rolling, buzzy “cheeer,” drier and more rattling than that of Greater Short-toed."
305,Gray-headed Canary-Flycatcher,/species/gyhcaf1/IN-PB-SH,"An unmistakable, dainty woodland flycatcher with a slightly peaked head shape. It has a gray head and upper breast with a narrow white eyering. Upperparts are olive-green; breast and belly are bright yellow. An active member of mixed-species foraging flocks, but also seen singly or in pairs. Quite vocal, with a loud, squeaky whistled song delivered throughout the year: “wi-tu-wi-tu-wee!” or “wi-wuh-wuh-wee!!”. Frequently gives a rapid-fire series of high bouncy notes that rises quickly, then trails off. Other calls include sharp “chilup,” “kitwik,” or “chit” notes repeated a few times."
306,Curlew Sandpiper,/species/cursan/IN-PB-SH,"Medium-sized wader with a long, slightly downcurved bill. Slightly larger than Dunlin, with longer and finer bill, longer legs. In flight note large white rump patch. Breeding plumage deep rusty on head and body (like Red Knot). Non-breeding birds are grayish-brown above with white eyebrows and belly. Juvenile is grayish above with neat scaly feather edgings, whitish below with variable buffy wash on breast. Breeds in Russian tundra and winters in Africa, Australia, and South and Southeast Asia. Mainly in coastal wetland habitats, often with flocks of Dunlin."
307,Red-billed Blue-Magpie,/species/rbbmag/IN-PB-SH,"Raucous, vividly-colored magpie of lowland and foothill forests, gardens, and parks. Bright blue with black head, white belly, and long tail which trails loosely behind it in flight. Bright scarlet bill and extensive white crown serve to distinguish this species from the otherwise similar Yellow-billed Blue-Magpie. Travels in groups, communicating with constant, raucous, hoarse calls. Aggressive, often driving away other birds."
308,Mountain Chiffchaff,/species/mouchi2/IN-PB-SH,"Very similar to Common Chiffchaff, but distinctly darker brown, and lacks any green or yellow tones including uppertail coverts and fringes to wing feathers. Note the brownish wash to underparts, especially the flanks, the rather contrasting whitish throat, and white eyebrow. Bill and legs distinctly black. Short primary projection. Breeds in forested mountains, valleys, and foothills, including low-stature mixed forest; winters in lower elevation scrub, including acacia and tamarisks. Call similar to Siberian Chiffchaff: a high-pitched, slightly downslurred ""Piiu."" Song similar to Common Chiffchaff but faster and less “organized.”"
309,Rufous-breasted Accentor,/species/rubacc1/IN-PB-SH,"Brightly-colored accentor which combines the head pattern of Black-throated Accentor with the orange breast of Robin Accentor. Bright orange breast and eyebrow are striking, contrasting sharply with the white throat and streaked brown back. Generally, quite common in high-altitude deciduous forests where it breeds. Descends into lower, often scrubbier, habitats during the winter."
310,Rock Bunting,/species/rocbun1/IN-PB-SH,"Large, distinctive bunting. Males have a boldly black-striped gray head and breast, chestnut underparts, and streaked upperparts. Females and juveniles similar to males, just more subdued. Breeds on rocky slopes just above the treeline, preferring bushy areas with scattered trees. Feeds on seeds and invertebrates. Unobtrusive, although not particularly shy. Clear, high-pitched song draws attention to its presence."
311,Common Quail,/species/comqua1/IN-PB-SH,"Small pear-shaped gamebird. Breeds in taller grassland and grain fields from western Europe east to central Asia and winters in similar habitat in Africa, southern Europe, and South Asia. Rarely seen, and most often detected by male’s emphatic whistled ""wet-my-lips!"" song, which can be given at night. When flushed, explodes from underfoot and flies off strongly with whirring wingbeats and short glides. Plumage cryptic and streaky brown with pale eyebrow; male has black throat stripe. Very similar to Japanese Quail, whose male has a much darker face; females, immature birds, and domestic types (kept as captive for eggs and can escape) are probably not safely separable in the field."
312,Besra,/species/besra1/IN-PB-SH,"A medium-sized Accipiter of forested areas. Adult grayish brown above with a grayer head and neck, pale underparts with orange barring and blotches, and distinctive dark line in center of white throat. Coloration overall recalls Crested Goshawk, but the goshawk is much bulkier. Juvenile browner overall, with vertical brown streaking on the breast and belly."
313,Sykes's Warbler,/species/sykwar2/IN-PB-SH,"Plain brown warbler with pale legs. Breeds in Central Asia; winters primarily on the Indian peninsula. Prefers trees with sparse canopy in open, dry habitat. Can be told from Blyth’s Reed Warbler by its leaf-warbler-like behavior and longer tail, and from Booted Warbler by its less compact appearance; flatter stance; longer pale bill (mostly without a dark tip); longer, more loosely attached tail; more pointy face; harder call; and preference for canopy tops. Call is a hard, fast, continuous arrhythmic “thk…thk, thk, thk.”"
314,Gull-billed Tern,/species/gubter2/IN-PB-SH,"Medium-sized tern with thick black bill. Very pale overall with black cap in breeding plumage. Legs black. Nonbreeding plumage shows dark cheek patch. Found in marshier habitats than most other terns, in the Americas usually near the coast but not on the ocean (though also occasionally seen on beaches and mudflats); in Europe and Asia can also be found in wetlands well away from the coast. Rarely seen in flocks with other terns; often single or in pairs. Feeds on invertebrates and crabs in mud and marshes; often patrols the edges of ponds but does not grab fish from the water like other terns."
315,Bristled Grassbird,/species/brigra2/IN-PB-SH,"Large brown warbler with a streaked back and a long broad tail. Chunkier and shorter-tailed than much larger Striated Grassbird. Clambers around the dense tall grasses of lowland grasslands; favors areas with scattered shrubbery. Reclusive and will generally not flush twice in succession. Song a springy “wee-chew, chewa-wee!”, given from top of vegetation or in flight."
316,Yellow Bittern,/species/yelbit/IN-PB-SH,"Very small heron of marshy, well-vegetated water bodies. Adult pale orangish brown or yellow, depending on the light, with a narrow dark cap. Juvenile darker above with pale feather edges. Can be inconspicuous in dense vegetation, but frequently makes short flights; on flying birds, note dark flight feathers contrasting with pale yellowish wing coverts. Typically quiet, but occasionally gives harsh grating calls when flushed."
317,Striated Heron,/species/strher/IN-PB-SH,"A very widespread small heron, common across much of the globe. Small size and overall gray color separates from most other herons and bitterns. Look for contrasting dark cap, distinct pale edges on wing feathers, and white and rufous stripes on front of neck. Juvenile streakier below than adult. Similar to Green Heron but note mostly gray neck with restricted rufous. Juvenile is much smaller and more slender than juvenile Black-crowned Night-Heron, with long streaks on the chest and spotting restricted to the wings. Normally solitary, found standing quietly around wetland habitats such as marshes, agricultural fields, rivers, and lakes."
318,Savanna Nightjar,/species/savnig1/IN-PB-SH,"Well-camouflaged nightbird, usually encountered roosting on gravel riverbeds, open areas in grasslands, rooftops, or roadsides. Sometimes found in small loose flocks when roosting. Fairly well adapted to urban life in some parts of its range and often found in towns and city edges. Intricately patterned gray-brown with less white than other nightjars; only males have a fairly small white patch on the wing near the tip. Most often detected by its distinctive, high-pitched, burry “chree-ik” song, repeated over and over."
319,Mottled Wood-Owl,/species/mowowl1/IN-PB-SH,"Medium-sized patchy-looking owl with dark eyes. Densely-marked orange-and-gray coloration is unique. Typically gives single hoots, but also gives an odd, mellow tremolo vocalization in the breeding season. A lowland species, favoring groves and clusters of trees in open plains and on the edges of cultivated areas."
320,Indian Blue Robin,/species/inbrob1/IN-PB-SH,"Male is slaty-blue with a white eyebrow, dark face, and orange underparts. Female is matte brown with buffy underparts; females in the Chin Hills have a slate-gray back. Furtive and skulky; male sings from deep cover, giving a series of sharp whistles devolving into a burst of trilling and chattering notes. Prefers dense, damp undergrowth in wet forests, often in proximity to streams and gullies."
321,Fire-capped Tit,/species/fictit1/IN-PB-SH,"More of a soft blush than a burning flame, the red patch on the male’s face is nonetheless unique. The female lacks the red patch, but is still distinctive in her size, small sharp bill, and pale wingbars. Both sexes are yellow above and pale gray below, with the male being more predominantly yellow than the female. Found in montane broadleaf forest at middle to high elevations, sometimes mixed in with other species; some populations descend to lower foothills and lowlands in the winter. Song is an undulating series of twitters, chips, and trills; also twitters and trills when flocking."
322,Common Shelduck,/species/comshe/IN-PB-SH,"Distinctive, large, rather gooselike duck of coastal wetlands, tidal mudflats, and nearby grassy fields. Striking plumage often looks simply black-and-white; at close range, head is deep glossy green, broad breast band dark rusty. Male has raised knob at base of red bill; juvenile duller overall, with whitish face and eyering. Less numerous and more local inland at lakes and along rivers. Often seen walking and grazing, at times in flocks."
323,Rufous-bellied Niltava,/species/rubnil1/IN-PB-SH,"As in other niltavas, the male is brilliantly colored while the female is drab brown overall. Male bright blue with an orange belly; female is brown with a white throat strap and a small blue crescent on the neck. Female is very similar to other niltavas, intermediate in size between Little and Large niltavas, with stronger warm tones on the wings and tail than Fujian Niltava. Active in the middle and upper layers of broadleaf and mixed hill forests, where it often associates with other species in mixed flocks. Gives a series of high, piercing metallic whistles."
324,White-capped Redstart,/species/whcred1/IN-PB-SH,"Chunky, brightly-colored redstart found along rushing boulder-strewn mountain streams. Black with a wine-red belly and tail and a blazing white cap; in poor lighting, appears all dark save for the cap. Sexes similar. Frequently flicks tail up and down and flares it open while perched on a streamside rock or stump. Call is a long, sharp whistle with an abrupt ending, with a far-carrying, ventriloquial quality."
325,Brown Shrike,/species/brnshr/IN-PB-SH,"Medium-sized shrike with a slender black mask and rufous-brown rump and tail. Plumage varies across range: “Japanese” has the warmest rufous tones, “Philippine” has a gray-washed head and back, and “Brown” averages in between. Averages stronger-billed in appearance than other medium-sized “brownish” shrikes. Male’s repetitive song often incorporates imitations of other birds. Most common call is a dry “ch-ch-ch.” Favors open forests and fields with scattered trees and bushes; often in parks and gardens."
326,Eurasian Curlew,/species/eurcur/IN-PB-SH,"Scimitar-billed large shorebird of varied open habitats. Note large size, overall brown plumage, and long, decurved bill (appreciably shorter on juvenile). In flight shows white back patch, mostly white underwings. Common call an onomatopoeic ""coor-lee."" Compare to smaller Whimbrel, which has head stripes, a piping whistled call, and Far Eastern Curlew, which has a buffy rump and extensively marked underwings. Breeds mainly in grasslands, from coastal marshes to upland moors; winters mainly in coastal lowlands, especially mudflats and adjacent marshes."
327,Puff-throated Babbler,/species/putbab1/IN-PB-SH,"Personable medium-sized babbler, often encountered foraging in noisy, lively flocks on or around the forest floor. Clay-colored with brown-streaked pale underparts. White brow and throat contrast with buffy cheeks and a rusty-orange crown. Occurs from lowlands up into hilly and mountainous forests. Song can be a distinctive series of two to three notes (“two-chee-deer!”), a more extended melodic warble, or a descending chattering trill. Gives rasping, rattling calls, often while flipping leaves on the ground in foraging flocks."
328,Greater Short-toed Lark,/species/gstlar1/IN-PB-SH,"Small pale lark, usually seen foraging on the ground in open areas with scattered low vegetation, cultivated fields, or at roadsides. Keeps low to the ground, runs quickly. Short bill and rounded head; long tertial feathers largely hide the wings at rest. Dark patch at the neck sides and largely unstreaked belly distinctive in most plumages. Drifting, hovering song flight delivered with tail folded."
329,Baillon's Crake,/species/baicra1/IN-PB-SH,"Widespread across Africa, Eurasia and Australasia. Tiny crake that breeds in wet sedge marshes and bogs; migrants can be in any marshy habitat. Usually retiring and rarely seen, but can be confiding. Although unmistakeable in parts of its range, it can sometimes co-occur with the similar Little Crake. Best told by its shorter wings, short, greenish bill that lacks red base and barred flanks; juvenile darker and more extensively barred below than juvenile Little Crake."
330,Eurasian Skylark,/species/skylar/IN-PB-SH,"Like most larks, often inconspicuous on the ground and best detected by voice. The prolonged warbling and trilling song is given in flight, often so far overhead that the bird appears as a speck, if you can even see it. On the ground, note brown streaky plumage, distinct bushy crest, and broad, diffuse paler eyering. Chunkier than pipits, and does not habitually bob its rear end. In flight shows white sides to tail and narrow white trailing edge to wings. A denizen of open country, especially rough grassland, heathland, farmland, and airports."
331,Pin-tailed Snipe,/species/pitsni/IN-PB-SH,"Cryptic shorebird of wetlands, wet meadows, and both flooded and dry agricultural fields. Extremely similar in appearance to other snipe, particularly Swinhoe's Snipe; careful study and photography usually required to confirm identification. Namesake diagnostic thin gray outer tail feathers are only visible when tail is spread. Lacks Common Snipe's eye-catching white trailing edge of the wing. Averages less buffy than both Common and Swinhoe's, with slightly bolder white edgings to the wing feathers; darker and more richly colored than Latham's Snipe. In flight, toes project further beyond tail than in other Asian snipe. When flushed, gives a rasping call that is not as loud as Common Snipe’s call; also flies less erratically than that species."
332,Dark-sided Flycatcher,/species/dasfly/IN-PB-SH,Small brown flycatcher with dark smudging on the breast and sides that lend it a “vested” appearance. Tends to prefer higher-elevation forests for breeding than Asian Brown and Gray-streaked Flycatchers but uses a variety of open forests and gardens on migration and in winter. The generally darker appearance of this species when compared to Asian Brown makes the eyering more striking.
333,White-tailed Stonechat,/species/whtsto2/IN-PB-SH,"An active little bird that inhabits reeds and tall grasses in low-lying wetlands. Flicks its tail often to reveal white feathers with black edges and tips. The male has a black hood with a neat border along the collar, white underparts, and a red patch on the breast. Its back is black in the breeding season and brown with streaks in the nonbreeding season. The female is grayish-brown with an indistinct supercilium and a white throat. Both sexes similar to Common Stonechat, but female White-tailed Stonechat is paler, while the male appears whiter below and shows the white in the tail when flicked or in flight."
334,Rosy Starling,/species/rossta2/IN-PB-SH,"Adult is unique, a vision in glossy black and pale pink. Juvenile is brown with an orange bill. Breeds in colonies on steppes and winters in open and wooded habitats. Gathers in huge numbers to roost, often mixing with other species at roost sites. Flocking birds keep up a constant cacophony of dry chattering calls."
335,Common Crane,/species/comcra/IN-PB-SH,"Generally uncommon in open, mainly wild country. Breeds from reedy lakeshores to boggy clearings in boreal forest, winters in wetlands and farmland. Very large and tall, with distinctive ""bustle"" on lower back. Adult has black-and-white head pattern, small red crown patch. Flight unhurried, with neck outstretched (unlike herons), and stiff wingbeats quickest on upstroke; groups often fly in V-formation, like geese. Loud, rolling calls carry long distances."
336,Wallcreeper,/species/wallcr1/IN-PB-SH,"Unmistakable, but difficult to spot on rock faces. Spectacular in flight, with broad black, red, and white-spotted wings resembling a giant butterfly. Usually found on rock faces in high mountainous regions, but also breeds in steep gorges lower down and can even be found on tall buildings in winter. Breeding male has a black throat; winter males and all females have white throats. Rarely-heard song is a steadily rising whistle."
337,Hen Harrier,/species/norhar1/IN-PB-SH,"Medium-sized harrier, flies with wings held in a V-shape, low over open fields and marshes, listening for rodents lurking below. Distinctive foraging behavior and conspicuous white patch on rump in all plumages. Five long primary ‘finger tips’ prominent in flight. Females and immatures are warm brown with streaky breasts. Adult male has plain mid-gray wings with black wingtips and paler belly."
338,Oriental Pied-Hornbill,/species/orphor1/IN-PB-SH,"A small black-and-white hornbill with a whitish-yellow bill and “helmet.” Primarily black, but with a white belly, facial patch, and wing and tail edges. Sexes are similar, but males have a much larger “helmet” than the female. More tolerant of human habitation than other hornbills and can sometimes be found in large city parks as well as open forests and edges. Noisy and social, often giving loud yapping calls to flockmates."
339,Stork-billed Kingfisher,/species/stbkin1/IN-PB-SH,"Massive kingfisher with a large scarlet bill. Head is olive-brown with dark green-blue upperparts and buff underparts. Wings and tail bluer, with rump even paler blue, obvious in flight. Juvenile has dusky edges to feathers of breast and hindneck. Vocal in breeding season, giving a loud, far-reaching “peu-peu-pow” whistle, while its regular contact call is a loud laughing “ka-ka-ka” repeated 6-10 times. Prefers large streams, rivers, and the edges of large water bodies with vegetated banks."
340,Richard's Pipit,/species/ricpip1/IN-PB-SH,"Large, robust, almost thrushlike pipit given the big bill, long and pale eyebrow, and long tail. If perched off the ground the very large hind claws and long legs are obvious. Flight is strong, heavy, and bounding. Utters ""pshee"" call when flushed. Found in open grasslands, stubble fields, farmland, dunes, and salt marshes. Separation from other large pipits can be difficult; pay attention to call and wing pattern."
341,Pallid Harrier,/species/palhar1/IN-PB-SH,"Males are ghostly gray above with black wingtip wedges. Females are more difficult to separate from other harriers; pay attention to the underwings with their barred primaries and dark secondaries. Juveniles are rufous and similar to Montagu’s, but appear dark rather than pale faced. In flight, a bit bulkier than Montagu’s but much more buoyant than Hen Harrier. Found in steppes, wet grassland, agricultural areas and other open spaces. Sometimes forms flocks outside of the breeding season, occasionally mixing with other harrier species."
342,Watercock,/species/waterc1/IN-PB-SH,"Large, distinctive marsh dweller, elusive and often difficult to see in the heavily vegetated wet fields and marshes it inhabits. Male is unmistakable, with black body, brown-edged wing coverts, and red-and-yellow bill with raised, spiky red frontal shield (unlike smaller moorhen). Females and immature are similarly large but speckled brown above with tan faces, and lack male’s frontal shield. Males are very vocal when breeding, producing liquid-sounding gulps comparable to a water bottle emptying. Both sexes make a range of incisive, guttural clucking and creaking calls, as well as a sharp “keek” in alarm."
343,Common Merganser,/species/commer/IN-PB-SH,"Large duck with a sleek body and thin red bill. Breeding males have a dark green head and mostly white body with peachy blush on underparts. Females and immature males have rusty brown head and gray bodies with a cleanly demarcated white throat. Feeds in rivers, lakes, and large ponds by diving to catch fish. Hardy in winter, often staying as far north as open water permits."
344,Desert Wheatear,/species/deswhe1/IN-PB-SH,"Small dark-winged bird found in dry, open areas with sparse vegetation. Frequently seen perched up on posts, telephone lines, and rock mounds. Breeding male is soft brown above and pale below with a tan breast and a jet-black face, wings, and tail; nonbreeding male’s face is mottled instead of solid black. Female is more modestly colored and is gray above with less extensive black on the wings. Beware of very similar female Northern Wheatear, which tends to be warmer-colored, especially on the breast and has more extensive white in the tail than Desert Wheatear. Bright white rump in both sexes contrast sharply with black tail when in flight. The male’s song starts out with brief series of short, sweet whistles, and ends with a mellow rolling note. Calls are dry and somewhat chattery."
345,Greater Flamingo,/species/grefla3/IN-PB-SH,"Distributed from Africa and southern Europe through West Asia to South Asia. Very large, with long, ""coat hanger"" neck, big kinked bill, and very long pinkish legs. Plumage at rest whitish with pale pink blush and some deep pink often visible on closed wings. Flies with long neck and legs extended, when deep pink-and-black wing pattern striking."
346,Great Gray Shrike,/species/norshr1/IN-PB-SH,"Thrush-sized bird; pale gray overall with black mask. In flight, watch for white patches in the wings. In areas of overlap, compare with other gray shrikes. Inhabits open habitats with scattered vegetation, from open forests to bogs and brushy meadows. Often seen on prominent perches, including power lines and short treetops, that offer perfect vantages for from which to spot prey. Carnivorous habits make shrikes unique among passerines, feeding on rodents and small birds. Vocalizations include bright short liquid trills and “gargling” phrases, often strung together into a repetitive song."
347,White-eared Bulbul,/species/whebul1/IN-PB-SH,"Dull gray-brown bulbul with a black head and bright white cheek patch. Also note yellow vent and white tail tip. A lowland species of dry forests, scrub, forest edge, parks, and gardens; can be quite common in cities and towns in parts of its range. Song brief but pleasant and fluid. Gives low raspy “chuk” as well as mellower call notes similar to components of its song."
348,White-rumped Vulture,/species/whrvul1/IN-PB-SH,"A medium-sized vulture with a silvery bill, a dark body, a grayish shine on the wings, a white back, and a distinctive white collar on the neck. In flight, the adult appears dark with a strikingly large white slab running across the underside of the wing. The juvenile is dark brown with fine pale streaks; it has a dark collar, pale feathers on the head, a dark bill, and no white on the back or underwing. Found in open areas and around habitation."
349,Spanish Sparrow,/species/spaspa1/IN-PB-SH,"Similar in size and shape to House Sparrow. Breeding season males have a heavily streaked black breast and back and a rufous crown and nape. Males are duller in the nonbreeding season. Females are very difficult to separate from female House Sparrows but tend to have bigger bills and paler bellies. Colonial, builds huge stick nests, often in/under White Stork nests."
350,Rock Eagle-Owl,/species/roeowl1/IN-PB-SH,"Large brown “horned owl” of rocky hills and semi-desert, as well as thorn scrub and groves in arid areas. Very similar in appearance to Eurasian Eagle-Owl, but note weaker streaking on the underparts and smaller size; range overlap is limited. Hoot is higher-pitched than that of Eurasian Eagle-Owl, a sonorous “bou-woo.”"
351,Barnacle Goose,/species/bargoo/IN-PB-SH,"Handsome and distinctive. A rather compact and fairly small goose with big white face patch, silvery upperparts, and black neck and breast sharply demarcated from white belly. Breeds mainly in Greenland, Iceland, and Spitsbergen, and locally around the Baltic Sea. Winters in farmland and grassy wetlands mainly in coastal lowlands throughout northern Europe. Free flying feral birds resident locally at lakes and parks in the U.K. In main wintering areas, occurs in hundreds or even thousands; elsewhere, singles and family groups can be found among flocks of other geese. Rare but increasing visitor to northeastern North America, almost always with flocks of Canada Geese."
